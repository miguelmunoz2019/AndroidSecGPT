Apps for depression, this is the exception rather than the rule. The app marketplaces continue to have relatively few checks for developers who wish to disseminate a product. Apps advertising uses for mental health issues do not have any additional checks to validate their claims nor their data security and privacy. Apps have great potential to scale mental health resources, to provide them to people who are unable or reluctant to access traditional face-to-face care. If digital mental health resources are to be a reasonable option; however, it is not sufficient to show that they are effective, they must also be safe, secure, and responsible. Just as therapists are held to standards of responsible practice and confidentiality, mental health app developers should be held to standards of safety, security, and privacy. Enforcing such standards could also raise clinicians' confidence in recommending such products to their patients. We suggest that before clinicians recommend a mobile app to their client, they first obtain its privacy policy and evaluate it for the criteria listed in Fig. 2. Overall, our findings suggest the field has a long way to go in regards to transparency around data handling, however, and it is unlikely practices will change without calling attention to this large need.
