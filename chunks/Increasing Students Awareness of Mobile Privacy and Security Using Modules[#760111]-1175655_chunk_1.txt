# ABSTRACT
Mobile devices are fast becoming the dominant computing platform for an increasing number of people. Indeed millions of people are using their mobile phones as the main way to access the internet and social and entertainment media. This surge in mobile devices usage has been accompanied by an increase in malware specifically designed to infect mobile devices. From an educational standpoint, it is then becoming imperative to inform students about the risks and threats of mobile devices, not only as users but also as developers of mobile software. However, the Computer Science and other IT related disciplines are suffering from an overcrowding of their respective curricula with an ever increasing number of topics and courses that need to be covered within a limited amount of time. A possible solution to this issue is the use of teaching modules. Modular teaching provides a framework in which new skills can be introduced with little time commitment on the part of the student and the instructor alike. It is also ideal for introducing subjects that are important to know and could fit within different subjects. This paper presents an experience in modular teaching of mobile security and privacy. Two modules have been designed and presented to two cohorts of students (n=14, n=10) and learning assessed through tests and surveys. Results show that the modular approach is indeed beneficial in filling students’ knowledge gaps in mobile security and that interleaving hands-on activities with instructional material can yield better retention and understanding of the topic.

# INTRODUCTION
Mobile devices have seen a surge in both interest and availability in the last few years. Indeed, the number of users of mobile devices has increased by 41% from 2010 to 2015 and reached 5 billion people. Additionally, for the first time, design and use of mobile media have surpassed design of desktop applications with almost 300 million apps downloaded in 2015. In the mobile environment, Google Android and Apple iOS have the lion’s share of the market with a little more than 94% of mobile phones running one of these mobile operating systems . Mobile applications (apps) usage also increased by 76% in 2014 , and recent reports have shown that people are using mobile apps for activities that involve financial transactions, such as shopping, checking bank or credit card accounts, paying mortgages . Indeed, numbers show that iOS sessions using shopping applications have increased by 174% in 2014, while on Android; the same sessions were up by 220% . As the use of mobile devices is spiraling up, this situation has also drawn the attention of hackers and mal intentioned programmers who are now devoting their efforts to designing malware for mobile devices. Between 2013 and 2014, there has been a notable 136% growth in mobile adware to 410,000 apps. Additionally, cyber-attacks are also becoming more sophisticated and dangerous, such as phishing attacks that give access to personal information stored in the device , or ransomware attacks, that lock the mobile device and request a ransom for it to be released to its owner . Investment in technology to prevent security risks on mobile devices has not been accompanied with a similar growth in skilled labor within the field, so much so that 30% of organizations complain of lack of experts in the topics of security analytics and mobile security . The purpose of this paper is to present teaching modules that aim at alleviating this problem by introducing material related to mobile security and privacy. The material is organized as independent modules that can be used by an instructor to introduce each topic to his/her students. The modules have been designed so that they can be used off-the-shelf, without requiring much customization on the part of the instructor.

believe that the modular approach will encourage an easy adoption by instructors and will offer students the opportunity to learn about this important topic in an easy and concise way. The rest of this paper is organized as follows; in the next section, we will discuss the characteristics of modular teaching and how suited it is to our work. The following sections will introduce in details the modules in terms of coverage and topics. We will next present an evaluation of the modules by two cohorts of students, discuss the results and then conclude.

# MODULAR TEACHING
Modular teaching has been used in various disciplines, such as medical training (Karthikeyan & Kumar, 2014), chemistry (Stewart & Wilkinson, 1999), and engineering . The most appealing aspect of the modular approach is that it incorporates various teaching modalities, which stimulate active participation from students and promotes learning.

In computing related curricula, such as computer science (CS), management of information systems (MIS) and software engineering (SE), there is an increasing competition over topics to be included in the undergraduate curriculum. Indeed, with the advent of the Internet and its attending subjects such as web programming, wireless networking, mobile applications programming etc., there is a need to offer students courses in these topics so as to prepare them for a competitive job market and afford them better employment opportunities once they graduate. On the other hand, many such programs aim at reducing the number of required credit hours so as to attract a maximum number of students into their program and lure them with fewer credit hours to graduation. Consequently, it is becoming apparent that students will have limited exposure, both in time and depth, to a number of subjects. This is not necessarily detrimental to the student, if one subscribes to the idea that some exposure is better than none, and moreover this could help students acquire a lifelong, independent learning mindset if they are to be successful in a career, in which practitioners have to re-invent themselves every few years to keep up with the advances in the field. In our approach, we believe that modular teaching can present a viable solution to this situation. Modular teaching provides a framework in which new skills can be introduced with little time commitment on the part of the student and the instructor alike. Modular teaching allows teachers, whose expertise is in a topic and wish to experience a different but related area, to get enough exposure to a new topic to be functional. The approach is also ideal for introducing subjects that are important to know but do not require a whole quarter or semester of instruction, or for introducing a piece of knowledge that could fit into many subjects . Instructional modules provide flexibility in planning teaching schedules, in that instructors can elect to pick one or more modules depending on their need and time availability.

Iqbal  stipulates that to be successful, a teaching module should have the following features:
- Clearly stated objectives
- Well defined scope
# MOBILE PRIVACY AND SECURITY
The “Enriching Security Curricula and Enhancing Awareness of Security” project is a collaboration of three Houston based universities: University of Houston, Texas Southern University and the University of Houston-Downtown. The project consists of several security related topics, which have been divided and designed as a set of teaching modules. Each module consists of relevant teaching material accompanied by exercises and open-ended questions. Each module can be offered individually or as part of a theme. The project includes three general themes: Security Analytics, Security and Privacy in Distributed Networks and Security beyond Computer Science.

Modules range in difficulty from basic, with material accessible to non-CS students, intermediate, with material accessible to students whose discipline is in a CS related field, and advanced, with material appropriate for CS advanced or graduate students. In this work, we focus on the Mobile Privacy and Security topic that is part of the Security and Privacy in Distributed Networks theme. This topic is in turn divided into three modules:
- a) Mobile Infrastructure Security
- b) Mobile Devices Security
- c) Mobile Applications Privacy and Security
These 3 modules provide, in our opinion, a comprehensive coverage of the mobile environment and afford the student a suitable.
