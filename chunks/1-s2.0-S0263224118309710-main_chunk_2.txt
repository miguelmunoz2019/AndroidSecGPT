# 2. Risk assessment
Risk assessment is a process that identifies the loss, vulnerability, damage and the consequence of the action affecting costs. It is important because it presents the evaluated impact of the attack. It also helps to establish the level of safety or risk of a mobile application. The risk mechanism offered by a mobile device protects the user from unwillingly installing the malware application  and it does this by informing the user in the permissive mode and ensuring the right trust. Risk assessment allows the mobile user to lower the potential consequence of a threat to an acceptable level. Refs.  define risk as a component that is made up of a combination of threats and vulnerabilities. It leaves an impact on an asset when the vulnerabilities are flawed. Some researchers treat risk as a single entity . The risk may result in a number of losses which include cost, performance degradation as well as functionality. Risk assessment identifies the significant measures that used to control the risk; it protects the asset from any of the threats and it cautions users to take reasonable steps to manage the risk. As a system, risk assessment is used to measure the risk so as to generate the risk zones on the Android applications. This study implemented static analysis technique approach to collect Android permission as proposed features for criteria evaluation. The proposed criteria are used for making a judgment in risk assessment.

1. The evaluation used 5000 samples of malware application from the Drebin  dataset and 5000 benign samples from AndroZoo , both were considered an extensive amount of data to be collected and analysed for mobile device research works.

2. The experiment evaluation used the permission based application that was extracted from AndroidManifest.xml.

3. The EZADroid was able to zone the risks into four (4) categories: very low, low, medium and high.

4. We applied statistical evaluation to measure the effectiveness of the EZADroid system.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the background of the research. Section 3 describes the related literature. Section 4 presents the research methodology. Section 5 describes the proposed approach. Section 6 explains the experiment and results and Section 7 concludes the paper.

# 2. Background
This section presents the background of the Android security mechanism, the risk assessment and the malware detection system. The increasing popularity of the Android and its widespread.

tion allows users to protect their sensitive data and code which could be compromised if unprotected . Any application to be installed in a mobile device needs to request permission from the user. However, a malware application known as LevelDropper has the capability to auto root itself on mobile devices; it also has the capability to perform the installation of other applications without the need of user’s confirmation . This demonstrates that permission-based Android security mechanisms need an enhancement in giving out warnings to users about the malware activities. Other than the Android security mechanism, the malware detection system is also able to detect malware activities. Two categories of malware detection approach are available: anomaly-based and signature based detection . These approaches have worked in the past but it is ineffective in evaluating the application risks. To optimize the malware detection system, the implementation of a risk assessment system is important.

Risk assessment analyzes any potential malicious applications through a statistical evaluation that is derived from chosen features which are the applications’ permission. Risk assessment categorized into a few steps encompassing: identifying, assessing, mitigating and monitoring as well as responding to the risk . To do risk assessment, a process of the assessment needs to be carried out in order to identify the probability and impact of the threat, which is calculated from the value of the asset, threat and vulnerability . The risk assessment that is developed aims to identify, quantify and prioritize the risk according to the criteria it sets. A traditional risk assessment approach identifies the mobile device as a single entity only  and also as an asset for confidential information . Examples of confidential information are calling history, location information, password and others . Similar to , risk assessment also analyses the asset based on the connectivity, device and data.

Risk assessment is also effective for assessing a specific vulnerability that monitors and responds to the risk. Such a process is normally performed by malware analysts to generate risk notifications which warn against potential malware activities . Nonetheless, without a proper approach that scrutinise the application, it is impossible to obtain an effective risk evaluation and an accurate risk zone. As discussed earlier, the proposed approach evaluates the risk based on the application permission. It is difficult to evaluate the risk when the application does not request access to any dangerous permissions. The Android malware such as DroidKungfuUpdate only uses certain permissions which exclude dangerous permissions . This problem was, however, solved by the mobile malware detection system which uses both the dynamic and the static analysis technique which provided good criteria for risk assessment that evaluates and categorises the application into a risk zone.

Identifying risks on mobile Android applications is an important step in risk assessment. In recent times, risk assessments are being conducted by different domains such as information security , health  and mobile security . Risk assessment, in combination with the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP), is able to improve the accuracy and the effectiveness of evaluating an application’s risk. The AHP is a structured technique for the multi-criteria decision-making approach that was developed by Saaty . With the ability for multicriteria decision making, AHP has used in many studies. It is broadly applicable because each application is well structured and effective in making a decision. For example, in fields of operation studies such as  and , they applied AHP to investigate the most applicable mobile service for the consumer. AHP method is used to identify the linkage between perceived performance benefit with and good practice in Small and Medium Enterprise (SME)  but  applied risk analysis to rating the building based on excellent, good, medium, low and poor as well as to lessen users’ safety. Within computer security studies, Refs.  adopted AHP to evaluate the trustworthiness of Android applications. Moreover, the methodology has proven to be very suitable for decision making and capable producing results that agree with expectations . According to a literature review by  shows that AHP most frequently used in multicriteria decision making and has been thoroughly tested by thousands of organization around the world for the last 35 years . The combination of AHP and risk assessment gives an advantage for decision making to assess quantitative of risk. In addition, a survey by  shows that AHP is a popular method to assess and manage information security risk. There are relatively few research works that use risk assessment to zone the risk in the study of malware. Based on this lack of research, it is also unlikely that an effective approach for evaluating the application risk is available. This lack has motivated the current study.

The significant process of assessing the risk is to determine the risk level. There are two approaches to do this : qualitative  and quantitative analysis. The qualitative risk analysis is an approach for ranking the impact and for identifying the risks according to the potentials. Ref.  proposed scoring as an approach to improve risk communication for the Android applications by using a probabilistic model. It is one way to prioritise the risks and responses . Another way is through the quantitative risk assessment approach which usually uses a quantitative scale to calculate cost , values of threat, vulnerability, and consequence of risk. Ref.  proposed a significant quantitative risk assessment network, the DroidRisk, for evaluating malicious activities on Android permissions. This framework relies on the risk assessment which provides risk signal warnings to the user about the potentially malicious activities. It also comes with a risk mitigation approach that allows for protection and control, blocking any threats before they attack, so as to reduce the impact . Risk mitigation is a process to control, remove and reduce the probability of the risk to an acceptable threshold . The andromaly  uses threat assessment to mitigate the threat by applying an automatic or manual response before sending the alerts to the user.
