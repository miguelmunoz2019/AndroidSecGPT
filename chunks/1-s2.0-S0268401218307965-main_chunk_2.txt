Building on these privacy-related constructs, MUIPC draws on the communication privacy management theory and relates to information privacy concerns in a mobile user context, which is divided into three dimensions to measure mobile users’ concerns: perceived surveillance, perceived intrusion, and secondary use of personal information. Perceived surveillance describes the tracking and profiling of mobile users through mobile technology capabilities , which are equipped with environment sensors such as built-in cameras, proximity sensors, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and global positioning system (GPS) receivers (Enck, 2011; Lienhard & Legner, 2015). In a taxonomy of privacy, Solove (2006, p. 490) defines surveillance as “the watching, listening to, or recording of an individual’s activities”. The sensors in mobile devices allow diverse possibilities regarding users’ environment, movement, orientation, and location, and thus, they enable to enhance mobile users’ tasks; however, at the same time, the sensors may evoke privacy risks and can lead to information disclosure (Keith, Babb, Lowry, Furner, & Abdullat, 2015; Zhang, Adipat, & Mowafi, 2009), which is closely related to an intrusion of mobile users’ privacy. Solove (2006, p. 549) defines intrusion as “invasions or incursions into one’s life. It disturbs the victim’s daily activities, alters her routines, destroys her solitude, and often makes her feel uncomfortable and uneasy”. For example, Google Maps or Apple Maps request access to the location of mobile users and as a result, users’ location is exposed. While this function is fundamental for the functionality of the navigation system of these apps, access is requested unnecessarily in a number of cases by other apps , leading to privacy intrusion and malicious use of personal information such as secondary use. Secondary use of personal information, which is also a dimension of CFIP, is defined as “the use of data for purposes unrelated to the purposes for which the data was initially collected without the data subject’s consent” (Solove, 2006, p. 519). The collection of personal information enables companies to use the information for marketing purposes, for example, in order to target offers more accurately to individuals’ interests (Culnan & Armstrong, 1999; Wang et al., 2016). Secondary use is described as an asymmetry of knowledge, because individuals are exposed to the uncertainty that they are likely to know little or nothing about the circumstances under which their personal information is captured, sold, or processed, which creates “a sense of powerlessness and vulnerability” (Solove, 2006, p. 520). One prominent example of secondary use of personal information is the recent Facebook privacy scandal, where approximately 87 million Facebook users’ data were collected by political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica without the users’ explicit consent to access their data . As a consequence, user growth on Facebook declined, for example, 3 million users in Europe abandoned Facebook, and Facebook shares decreased by 19%, which equaled a decline of $119 billion.

We choose the MUIPC construct as the focal variable of our study because our main interest are app permission requests and thus we focus on users in the mobile environment. Xu, Gupta et al. (2012, p. 13) arguably propose that “consumers’ concerns for information privacy are not only different but more aggravated in the mobile environment”. To that end, MUIPC is considered to be more suitable and a better-targeted instrument to address privacy concerns of mobile users (Keith, Babb, & Lowry, 2014; Lom, Thoo, Sulaiman, & Adam, 2018). The MUIPC instrument has been used in various studies. For example, Chen and Li (2017) conducted a survey with 284 mobile users and found that MUIPC has a significant impact on the intention to adopt security defensive software. Keith et al. (2014) designed a social geo-caching game, which they used for a field experiment with 568 participants to examine longitudinal behavior of actual information disclosure using the MUIPC instrument. Further studies use MUIPC to analyze the effects of privacy concerns on the sensitivity of mobile fitness data (Vitak, Liao, Kumar, Zimmer, & Kritikos, 2018), or address the moderating role of MUIPC in a mobile advertising context  and regarding the effect of app value as a privacy trade-off for mobile app downloads . The MUIPC instrument has also been used very recently in a study by Belanger and Crossler (2019), in which protective behaviors on mobile devices are in the focus of their analysis.

# 2. Antecedents of information privacy concerns
Since our aim is to investigate the influence of app permission concerns on mobile users’ information privacy concerns, we draw on the APCO model, which provides positivist privacy researchers with an overarching macro model that summarizes relationships of antecedents and outcomes of privacy concerns . The APCO model is considered to be subject to a continuous process of optimization including “an expanded set of antecedents as well as an exhaustive set of outcomes,” whereby the “ultimate objective should be a macro model that will prove useful across disciplines and contexts” (Smith et al., 2011, p. 1008). Following this recommendation, we present an APCO model in a mobile context in Fig. 1 with a focus on antecedents including prior privacy experience, computer anxiety, and perceived control, as well as app permission concerns as an antecedent of privacy concerns as the main focus of our study.

The APCO model suggests that privacy-related antecedents usually involve individual traits or contextual factors . Individual traits refer to personality differences such as introversion versus extroversion or independent-self versus interdependent-self, whereas contextual factors describe the specific context that the factors depend on such as the industry to which an organization belongs or different types of information with different levels of sensitivity . In our study, we focus on individual traits, of which our main focus are app permission concerns. We suggest that other relevant individual factors for mobile users’ privacy concerns regard prior privacy experience (privacy issues with mobile apps), computer anxiety (continuing automation through the ubiquity of mobile devices), and perceived control (privacy settings to control information retrieval through mobile apps). Due to the focus of our study, we view the APCO model from a mobile perspective and note that while prior privacy experience has been depicted in prior APCO models , we integrate computer anxiety, perceived control, and app permission concerns as new relationships; whereby, computer anxiety and perceived control have been established in prior studies (Stewart & Segars, 2002; Xu, Gupta et al., 2012). In order to enable a comparison of app permission concerns with other relevant antecedents of privacy concerns, we refer to prior privacy experience, computer anxiety, and perceived control, which have been suggested to be important predictors in the information privacy literature (Dinev et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2011, 1996; Stewart & Segars, 2002; Xu, Gupta et al., 2012).
