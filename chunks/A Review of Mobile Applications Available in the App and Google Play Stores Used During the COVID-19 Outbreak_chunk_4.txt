All the applications described above can be used by the majority of mobile device users around the world, are free and available on the Android and iOS platforms. However, the functionalities of the applications differed with respect to the health tools available. Ten out of twelve apps (Mawid, Tabaud, Tawakkalna, Aarogya Setu, TraceTogether, COVID Safe, Immuni, NHS COVID-19, COVID Watch, PathCheck SafePlaces) have the feature of assessing the userâ€™s status or risk assessment, and they were enabled with the option of reporting test results, which helps to analyze the spread of the virus and alert other users who have been in close contact with the infected person to take preventive measures. Four of the mobile applications (Mawid, Aarogya Setu, NHS COVID-19, and PathCheck SafePlaces) reviewed provided self-assessment tests, with which users can assess their status and access feedback about preventive measures. Two apps (Tawakkalna, Aarogya Setu) out of the twelve provided services for an E-pass or travel permit during the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, nine out of twelve apps (Tabaud, Tawakkalna, Aarogya Setu, TraceTogether, COVID Safe, Immuni, NHS COVID-19, COVID Watch, and PathCheck SafePlaces) provided a contact-tracing feature. Only one application (Mawid) allowed test reporting, so that users could book an appointment and receive healthcare services, but it was not enabled with contact-tracing features.

Focusing on the integration of health tools, it can be observed that the majority of the apps were enabled with contact tracing, test result reporting and self-assessment, reflecting the primary goal of these applications, which is.

to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. Several studies have reported similar findings, and they suggested that the majority of apps were focused on contact tracing and were available on both Android and iOS platforms. In addition, a few applications such as Mawid, Sehha, Aarogya Setu and PathCheck provided online consultations, facilitating the practice of social distancing and home quarantine procedures, and ensuring continuity in delivering healthcare services for various conditions/diseases. It should be noted that launching different apps for different services such as consultation, awareness (information), contact tracing and travel permits may confuse citizens and create ambiguity over the use of applications for COVID-19. Therefore, a single application integrating several services as in Arogya Setu and PathCheck may benefit citizens by allowing them to access services from a single application.

Five (Mawid, Sehha, Aarogya Setu, NHS COVID-19, PathCheck SafePlaces) out of the twelve apps provided options for personalised notes. Also, five of them (Sehha, Aarogya Setu, COVID Symptom Study, NHS COVID-19, and PathCheck SafePlaces) apps provided access to health educational resources and COVID-19-related information. With the rapid spread of myths and misinformation about COVID-19 across the world, it is of utmost importance that people are properly educated about COVID-19 and are made aware of precautionary measures, other treatments, and safety procedures. However, due to the functionality of specific applications, access to information is limited to a few applications.

Concentrating on the communication process, four (Mawid, Sehha, Aarogya Setu, PathCheck SafePlaces) out of twelve apps offered options for query resolution and four (Mawid, Sehha, NHS COVID-19, PathCheck SafePlaces) apps offered online booking of appointments. While no apps were identified that enabled a social networking feature, all of the applications reviewed provided notifications.

In addition, all of the applications provided a data visualisation feature with the use of graphics to present health-related information and COVID infections. Half of the reviewed applications (Tabaud, Sehha, Aarogya Setu, COVID Safe, NHS COVID-19, and PathCheck SafePlaces) offered a program plan option, while the other half did not. Similarly, half of the reviewed applications (Mawid, Tawakkalna, Aarogya Setu, TraceTogether, NHS COVID-19, PathCheck SafePlaces) used GPS location tracking features, while the other half (Tabaud, Sehha, COVID Symptom Study, Immuni, COVID Safe, COVID Watch) did not present this feature because of rising privacy concerns. As a result, the majority of the applications, eight out of twelve (Aarogya Setu, TraceTogether, NHS COVID-19, PathCheck SafePlaces, Tabaud, Immuni, COVID Safe, COVID Watch), relied on Bluetooth technology. Bluetooth Low Energy technology is effective and uses low amounts of energy; it can also be very effective for contact tracing in close proximities. Thus, the majority of the applications preferred Bluetooth Low Energy for contact tracing.

Although applications for managing COVID-19 are being launched and used, issues such as privacy, safety, security and data protection remain one of the major concerns. In view of rising concerns, applications such as TraceTogether, Immuni, COVID Watch, PathCheck, etc. have updated their privacy policy so that they collect no personal information that can reveal identity and they employ clear policies on data usage and destruction.

The main limitation of this work was that some applications for the management of COVID-19 could not be detected in the search due to the keywords used in this process. Another limitation is the fact that this work is not aimed at analyzing the total landscape of mobile phone applications used during the COVID-19 outbreak. Only free applications available in the App and Google Play stores used in India, USA, Saudi Arabia, Italy, UK, Singapore, and Australia were reviewed. Additionally, web-based applications such as COVIDNearYou or Coronaisrael were not included. Similarly, we did not perform a more robust search in publication indexes such as Pubmed, Web of Science, Scopus, or Google Scholar.

Future research can focus on reviewing the technologies, functions and features of the mobile applications dedicated to COVID-19, and publishing findings that can be used by medical practitioners, application developers, and governments to collaborate in the process of containing the spread of the novel coronavirus. Also, it would be interesting to investigate if social networking and innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) can be effective in improving various approaches related to COVID-19 management. A previous study suggested that AI, ML, and DL, can be effective in improving various approaches such as treatment, medication, screening, prediction, forecasting, contact tracing, and drug/vaccine.

# Development Related to Healthcare Services and COVID-19
# Conclusion
This study has reviewed the main mobile applications used during the COVID-19 outbreak to provide health care services, contain the spread of the new coronavirus, and facilitate the movement of people during curfews in Saudi Arabia, India, Italy, Singapore, the United Kingdom, United States of America, and Australia. The analysis revealed that various applications have been developed for different functions like contact tracing, raising awareness, appointment booking, online consultation, etc. However, only a few applications such as Arogya Setu and PathCheck have integrated various functions and features such as self-assessment, consultation, support and access to information in a single application, simplifying to the users the access to services. Also, most of the apps are focused on contact tracing, while very few are dedicated to raising awareness and sharing information about COVID-19, which is essential to combat the spread of COVID-19.

Likewise, the majority of applications rely on GPS and Bluetooth technologies for contact tracing and other relevant functions. No apps were identified that had built-in social media features. Furthermore, one of the main challenges identified was the lack of an integrated application with most of the features and functionalities analyzed in this study. In this sense, users depended on different applications for medical care, travel, diagnosis, tracking, and awareness, etc. Therefore, an effective solution to solve this problem can be to design and develop an integrated mobile health application, which allows access to all these functions. Using a single application can reduce costs and improve health data management, and decision making.
