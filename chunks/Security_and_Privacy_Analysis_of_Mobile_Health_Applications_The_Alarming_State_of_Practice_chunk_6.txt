Lack of encryption, use of GET instead of POST requests for sensitive data transmission, and insecure programming practices, are some of the major security and privacy open issues for developers to solve when building m-health apps. User profiling, either for advertising and marketing purposes or for user behavior monitoring, is an additional privacy concern that needs to be taken into account to guarantee users privacy. Even though the conformance to the current data protection regulations should provide m-health application users with data transparency, it is still a hard to achieve functionality. In particular, the upcoming enforcement of the GDPR in May 2018 within the EU is expected to meet with technical challenges, such as tracking and deleting user disseminated data to third parties, and designing and developing internal procedures satisfying GDPR auditing and data protection requirements.

In light of the above, security experts and privacy advocates raise the alarm about the potential privacy harms that derive from m-health apps processing personal and sensitive data, and urge for suitable countermeasures. As revealed by the European Commission’s 2014 m-Health Green Paper, European citizens do not trust m-Health apps since 67% of the surveyed population said they would never use any m-health capability of their mobile phone in support of their health. In an effort to build solid foundations and easily implementable privacy standards for the development of m-health applications, and specially for fostering trust among their users, European Commission issued in 2016 a draft “Code of Conduct on privacy for mobile health applications.” Although its final version is yet to be adopted, as it is subjected to the implementation of Article 29 Data Protection Working Party comments and to its conformance to the GDPR’s provisions, it is still a good reference point for providing practical guidelines to app developers in order to build reliable applications compliant with data protection standards and principles.

# APPENDIX
# PERSONAL, SENSITIVE AND HEALTH DATA
Within the EU domain and according to the GDPR, Article 4, personal data are defined as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. This definition clarifies that personal data are any information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate an individual. Hence, in the EU, any location information or any device ID which uniquely bind a place or a device respectively to an individual fall under the personal data category.

The US however have not adopted yet a comprehensive information privacy law but they are rather having limited sectoral laws in some areas, such as the HIPAA for health related data processing. Hence, there is not a universal definition of personal data across all of the States. Still, the Privacy Shield Framework (https://www.privacyshield.gov) between the EU and the US, specified to foster compliance with data protection requirements when transatlantic transferring of personal data is concerned, defines personal data as data about an identified or identifiable individual that are within the scope of the DPD, and the GDPR by extension. In Canada, where the Personal Information Protection and Electronic

Documents Act (PIPEDA) (https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/) has been active since 2001, personal information means information about an identifiable individual, but does not include the name, title, or business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization.

Even since the DPD era, health data were classified in a special category of personal data, called ‘‘sensitive’’, referring to data that reveal racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, and the processing of data concerning health or sex life. Under the GDPR, the ‘‘genetic data’’ and ‘‘biometric data’’ have been also expressly added in the sensitive data class, only in the case though that may be used for uniquely identifying a natural person. The sensitive data are generally prohibited from processing unless specific derogations and exemptions apply. For instance, the grounds of processing sensitive data under the GDPR, which are more or less similar to those defined in its predecessor DPD, include, apart from user’s explicit consent, some advanced conditions for processing, such as when the data are necessary for the purposes of preventative or occupational medicine, or for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, or necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, or scientific and historical research purposes or statistical purposes (Article 9-2 (a)-(j)). Across the Atlantic and despite the lack of a comprehensive personal data definition, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), an independent agency of the US government, issued in 2009 a report 1 suggesting that data considered as sensitive should include financial data, data about children, health information, precise geographic location information and social security numbers. Still, every organization in the US should evaluate independently the sensitivity of each individual personally identifiable information.

While health data are defined to be sensitive under all data protection regulations, the strict classification of which exact information falls under the category of health-related data has not been provided, up until recently, under any data protection act, leaving room to individual interpretations. The GDPR specifies in broad terms the types of data included in the definition of ‘‘data concerning health’’, and only substantially increases what is specified in the DPD.

It expressly covers both physical and mental health and explicitly defines that health data are all personal data relating to the physical or mental health of an individual, including the provision of health care services, which reveal information about his or her health status (Rec. 35, 53-54; Art(15)).

However, in 2015 the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party  published a letter  with an annex  clarifying the scope of the key legal term ‘‘health data’’ in relation to the lifestyle and wellbeing apps. According to this annex, health data are not certainly limited to ‘‘medical data’’ in the strict sense (i.e., data about an individual’s physical or mental health status generated in a professional medical context, including data generated by apps or devices used in this context). Instead, they include all data pertaining to an individual’s health status, regardless of the context in which they were collected and regardless of whether the information establishes ‘‘ill health’’. According to Art. 29 WP position, personal data are health data when:
1. the data are inherently/clearly medical data,
2. the data are raw sensor data that can be used in itself or in combination with other data to draw a conclusion about the actual health status or health risk of a person,
3. conclusions are drawn about a person’s health status or health risk (irrespective of whether these conclusions are accurate or inaccurate, legitimate or illegitimate, or otherwise adequate or inadequate).

Even though the Opinions and Recommendations published by the Art. 29 WP are not legally binding, still they do provide directions for conflict resolutions.

In the US, the HIPAA defines health data as the ‘‘Protected Health Information’’ (PHI) 3 that includes all ‘‘individually identifiable health information’’ held or transmitted by a covered entity or its business associate, in any form or media, whether electronic, paper, or oral. In particular, defines that health information means any information that: (i) is created or received by a health care provider, health plan, public health authority, employer, life insurer, school or university, or health care clearinghouse; and (ii) relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of any individual, the provision of health care to an individual, or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual. ‘‘Individually identifiable health information’’ is a subset of the PHI 4 which also identifies the individual or for which there is a reasonable basis to believe it can be used to identify the individual. Hence, individually identifiable health information includes many common identifiers (e.g., name, address, birth date, Social Security Number).
