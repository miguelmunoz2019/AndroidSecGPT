- The study of (Nassr et. al., 2019). ITS for Enhancing Training Methodology for Students Majoring in Electricity
This study focuses on the use of intelligent tutoring system for education and training of students specialized in electricity in the field of technical and vocational education. The use of modern systems in training and education will have a great positive impact in improving the level of students receiving training and education; this will improve the level of the local economy by producing students of professionals who are able to engage in society efficiently, especially for those who have specialized in electricity. It is known that students in electrical specialties face many problems because of time and cost. Learning and training is not as easy as you imagine, so intelligence is how to overcome these limitations effectively by motivating the Intelligent Tutorial System (ITS) for this type of training. This system consists of a student model, which in turn will contain lessons, exercises and examples that will be used by the student in addition to the user interface model which makes the teacher to be able to manage lessons, examples, and questions and make changes to the system. Expert System (ES) model representing the Artificial Intelligence (AI) here has been used to determine the level of the student and gives him the results, directions and levels. The program was implemented and was used by trainees to show the extent of its impact. The students expressed their surprise and admiration in this way of education as the system used focuses on individual education which can be used at any time and without restrictions. After this experience, the dedicated (ITS) system needs to be developed in several ways such as to be used on mobile systems and web systems in addition to linking some of the specialized programs in the field of electricity.

- The study of (Al Rekhawi et. al., 2018). DROID Tutor: Android Applications UI Development Intelligent Tutoring System.

The researchers described the design of a web-based intelligent tutoring system to teach Android applications development to students to overcome the difficulties they face. The basic idea of this system is a systematic introduction to the concept of Android applications development. The system introduces Android applications development and automatically manages the problems created for students to resolve. The system is automatically adapted at run time with individual student growth. The system provides clear support for adaptive transitions. A preliminary evaluation study was conducted to examine the impact of the use of intelligent tutoring system on the performance of students enrolled in the development of smart phone applications at the University College of Applied Sciences (UCAS) in Gaza. The results showed a positive impact on residents.

# Studies on Intelligent Tutoring Systems
- The study of (Mosa, Albatish et. al., 2018). ASP.NET Tutor: Intelligent Tutoring System for learning ASP.NET.

The researchers have been implementing a new intelligent tutoring system of tutorials that offer lessons and exercises for the ASP.NET language. Simply because it is one-to-one teacher, adapts to all individual differences of students, gradually starts with students of the most difficult level, saves time for the teacher and student, the student is not ashamed to make mistakes, and more. Therefore, they described the design of Intelligent Tutoring System to teach ASP.net to help students learn ASP.net easily and smoothly. It provides a beginner level tutor in ASP.net. Finally, they evaluated their tutor and the results were excellent by the students and the teacher.

- The study of (AbuEl-Reesh et. al., 2018). An Intelligent Tutoring System for Learning Classical Cryptography Algorithms (CCAITS)
In this research work, the researchers introduced an intelligent tutoring system for Learning Classical cryptography algorithms. The structure of this system and the elements of every part are presented in the first place, and then the program flow on which the agents in this system base to participate with the others to suggest reasonable learning pedagogical for individual student according to the evaluation of students' cognitive capability level is discussed. Moreover, the algorithm and procedure which are sophisticated to execute the designed functions of the agents explained. The suggested system for Learning Classical cryptography algorithms will derive adaptive learning pedagogical for individual student to learn in compelling and effective way. This an intelligent tutoring system concentrate on the students registered in Advanced Topics in Information Security in the faculty of Engineering and Information Technology at Al-Azhar University in Gaza and we suggest reasonable and suitable learning pedagogical for individual student to perform adaptive learning. During which the student will be able to think about the course and deal with related issues and solving the problems. An evaluation of the Learning Classical cryptography algorithms system was finished and the results were positive.

- The study of (Al-Bastami et. al., 2017). Design and Development of an Intelligent Tutoring System for C# Language
The authors are trying to help users learn C # programming language using the Intelligent Tutoring System. This service was developed using the ITSB authoring tool to be able to help the user learn programming efficiently and make the learning process very enjoyable. The knowledge base was used by using the ITSB authoring tool method to represent the user's work and to provide feedback and customized support to users.

- The study of (Weber and Prusilovsky, 2016). ELM-ART -An interactive and intelligent Web-based electronic textbook.

The researchers built a Web-based Intelligent Tutoring System (WITS) designed for teaching users programming in LISP (List Processing) programming language. It integrates intelligent educational system with electronic textbook program in a unique environment in which the user can broaden and deepen previously acquired knowledge. It was used as an intelligent interactive electronic textbook on programming in LISP programming language logic.

- The study of (Mona H. Mahmoud and Abo El-Hamayed, 2016). An intelligent tutoring system for teaching the grammar of the Arabic language
In this research work, an Intelligent tutoring system presented to simulate the behavior of the educational process. Any intelligent tutoring system consists of a Tutoring Model, a question selector, an Expert Model, a student model, and a graphical user interface. This work is presented in parallel with implementing a project called “Arabic Grammar Tutor” which was quoted as “AGTUTOR”. A part of this project is adopted and discussed in this paper. This part consists of the first three models of the ITS. These models are: The Tutor Model, the Question Selector Model, and the Expert Model. Moreover, the knowledge base and/or domain knowledge will be also conducted. Such models are implemented and tested. The curriculum of the Arabic grammar of the fourth grade; elementary schools in Egypt; is adopted as a domain knowledge. Moreover, some sort of text analysis will be considered.
