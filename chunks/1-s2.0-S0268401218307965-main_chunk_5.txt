The correlation matrix also helped to determine if any of the correlations were above 0, which would indicate that common method bias (CMB) may exist . The observed correlations were below the 0 threshold (see Table 3). We further assessed CMB ex post through Harman’s single-factor test. All items from the constructs were included in an unrotated exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to determine whether the majority of the variance could be ascribed to one general factor (Lowry & Gaskin, 2014; Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003). Harman’s single-factor test in this study produced 27 distinct factors, the largest of which explained only 37% of the variance of the model. Another ex post approach to examine CMB suggests to conduct a full collinearity test in order to ensure that all factor-level variance inflation factors (VIFs) are lower than 3, which is also an indication that a model can be considered free of CMB.

Since the convergent and discriminant validity criteria for the measurement model were met and CMB was not likely to exist in our model, we proceeded with the path coefficient estimations of the PLS-SEM. As suggested by Xu, Gupta et al. (2012), we created a second-order model to assess the structural model for collinearity issues.

Path coefficients and effect sizes of the structural model.

Notes: *** p < 0; ** p < 0; * p < 0; Cohen’s f²-statistics = [R²incl. – R²excl.] / [1- R²incl.] with f² ≥ 0 = small effect size, f² ≥ 0 = medium effect size, and f² ≥ 0 = large effect size.

We found PPE and CA have direct positive effects on MUIPC with significance levels of p < 0 and small effect sizes, supporting H1 and H2. As hypothesized, results show that PC has a direct negative effect on MUIPC, supporting H3, however, the significance level decreases from p < 0 (Model 1) to p < 0 (Model 2) when APC is included in the model. Moreover, the small effect size of PC becomes very small after APC is included. Model 2 further reveals that APC has a direct positive effect on MUIPC with a path coefficient of β = 0 at a significance level of p < 0 and a very large effect size (f² = 1). Thus, H4 is supported. Finally, we found MUIPC has a direct negative effect on INT with a path coefficient of β = –0 at a significance level of p < 0, supporting H5. Overall, the percentage of variance explained for MUIPC increases from 18% (Model 1) to 61% (Model 2), when APC is included in the model. Fig. 3 shows the results of the structural equation modeling.

# 6. Discussion
# 6. Discussion of findings
This study aims to clarify the role of app permission requests regarding mobile users’ information privacy concerns compared to prior privacy experience, computer anxiety, and perceived control. Results of a PLS-SEM analysis with 775 respondents indicated that all four antecedents influence users’ privacy concerns, with app permission concerns having a major impact. Through our study, we confirm significant effects of prior privacy experience, computer anxiety, and perceived control on privacy concerns, as previously reported in prior studies (Osatuyi, 2015; Smith et al., 1996; Stewart & Segars, 2002; Xu, Gupta et al., 2012). However, the construct of app permission concerns has approximately twice as much predictive value than the other factors put together to explain mobile users’ overall information privacy concerns. This implies that app permission concerns have an important effect on mobile users’ concerns for information privacy and that researchers should not exclude it from future models. Following Wang et al.’s (2016) suggestion, our findings support the notion that the wired environment is critically different from the mobile environment, which we presume has made another major shift with the rising popularity of mobile apps and growing app permission requests. Accordingly, we suggest that future mobile privacy research should find new ways of alleviating concerns for app permission requests, which will provide practical implications for app stores and providers.

# 6. Contribution to theory
Our study contributes to existing privacy research in several ways. First, our primary contribution is to clarify the role of app permission requests regarding mobile users’ concerns for information privacy. While prior studies have focused on distinct characteristics of app permission requests such as permission sensitivity, justification, or desensitization , in this research, we analyze mobile users’ concerns for app permission requests per se and the impact on their overall information privacy concerns. While Gu et al. (2017) found sensitivity and justification to be significantly influencing privacy concerns, in Harris et al.’s (2016) study, desensitization of excessive permission requests had no significant impact on risk perceptions to install an app. The insights from these studies support the assumption that app providers should take the sensitivity of app permissions into account and provide reasonable justification whenever permissions are requested; however, users do not seem to become desensitized to excessive permissions, and our findings support that assumption given the major impact of app permission concerns on mobile users’ privacy concerns. From this, we suggest that future mobile privacy research can build on our findings and extend the theory on privacy by seeking opportunities to mitigate app permission concerns, which will eventually further extend contributions to mobile users’ information privacy concerns.

Second, we respond to Smith et al.’s (2011) call for research to investigate an expanded set of antecedents across contexts in the APCO model. We chose the mobile environment as the context of our study and while prior privacy experience was introduced in prior APCO models , we integrated further factors in our mobile-related APCO model including computer anxiety and perceived control drawn from prior privacy studies (Stewart & Segars, 2002; Xu, Gupta et al., 2012), as well as app permission concerns as a new antecedent. Our study extends the literature by proposing these factors as antecedents in the APCO model from a mobile perspective, because with the growing popularity and ubiquity of mobile apps there is not only an increase of privacy issues with mobile apps, but there is also a growing concern for the continuing automation which induces anxiety, an ambiguity of privacy settings leading to a loss of control, and an incremental increase of excessive app permission.

Based on our findings, which suggest that the construct of app permission concerns is the most important antecedent of mobile users’ privacy concerns, it would be important for mobile privacy researchers to include app permission concerns in the examination of antecedents of privacy concerns in future mobile-related APCO models.

# 6. Implications for practice
From a practical perspective, app stores and providers should be alarmed that unnecessary and excessive app permission requests have a strong effect on users’ privacy concerns, which can prevent users from installing mobile apps or make them feel uncomfortable with the result being that they uninstall an app . As a consequence, app providers should ensure that they access personal information stored on mobile devices only if necessary and justified with value-added services, such as location tracking due to navigation purposes. As per our results show, app permission concerns have a highly significant impact on mobile users’ overall information privacy concerns. Considering the large effect of app permission concerns, app providers should reduce permission requests to a required minimum. Due to this large effect, we further suggest that enhancements of the design and presentation of app permission requests are required to respond to the ever-growing privacy concerns of mobile users. For example, the ambiguity and uncertainty of the safety and necessity of app permissions could be resolved by user-generated ratings, which have become ubiquitous and influential on the Internet and the mobile app market (Chang, Ku, & Chen, in press; Gao, Greenwood, Agarwal, & McCullough, 2015; Liu, Au, & Choi, 2014), and which could also help to illuminate privacy assurances of mobile services. Results of this study lead to the recommendation that the mitigation of mobile users’ privacy concerns is important more than ever due to the rapid growth of mobile apps and excessive app permission requests as a consequence thereof.
