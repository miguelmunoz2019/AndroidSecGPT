# Develop Measures
To support the adoption of usable security research results in the software industry, development teams need actionable measures. Researchers can support arguments for usable security in teams by developing measurable goals, actions, and interventions. Without those, blockers might be too challenging, as described by P19. We recommend measures to be lightweight in order to take the limited resources and economic pressures into account (see Section IV-G1) and remain in line with general security research ,.

# VI. CONCLUSION
In this work we provide novel insights into how professional software development organizations make usable security using 25 semi-structured interviews with software industry workers from different professions. Our results suggest a high impact of individual as well as contextual software development process factors on software products’ usable security, such as the commitment to usable security and knowledge of user-centered methods. Our study highlights the need for more awareness and a holistic understanding of usable security. Based on blockers and structures that contribute to usable security, we propose interventions for industry, such as deliberately strengthening the communication between security and usability experts. To successfully integrate usable security into software products, we recommend that researchers and practitioners take a holistic view on software development, also taking into account contextual factors.

# APPENDIX A
# PARTICIPANTS
Table III gives an overview of our participants. We did not include sensitive information such as age and gender on a per-participant basis to protect our participants’ privacy. However, this data is reported in aggregated form in Table I. We purposely do not link contexts to individual interviews for participant and company privacy, as some participants were recruited from our professional network. Identifying product, company size, experience, etc. could help re-identify those who volunteered to participate in our study. We think this should not impact the paper: Our coding and interpretation included our contextual knowledge; thus, our results are informed by this link. For privacy reasons, we omit the link in Tables II and III. Consequently, when we quote participants where their context is relevant, we identify them with the context; whenever their personal experience is most relevant, we quote them with their participant ID.
