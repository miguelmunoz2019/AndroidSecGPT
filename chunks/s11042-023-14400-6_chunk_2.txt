# 3 Types of malicious attacks and mobile vulnerabilities
# 3 Types of malicious attacks
A malicious attack (threat) is an attempt to abuse and exploit another computer by various means. These are threats to access personal data without the victim’s knowledge and to take control of the device.

There are three types of threats including phishing, social engineering, and MITM.

1. Social engineering is a type of threat made by malicious social engineers to obtain your personal information from you by imitating the script (prosecutor, police, banker). Social

# 2. Engineering Threats on Smartphones
Engineering threats on smartphones often occur through advertising. Malware is often secretly embedded in the content of adware and can be run independently of the user.

2. Phishing apps are fake apps that pretend to be a real secure app on the user’s smartphone, trying to get hold of a person’s login password and other information.

3. A man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) is the eavesdropping of communication between two links to capture and manipulate packets on the network. With this attack, the connection can be interrupted, or misleading communication can be created.

# 3 Mobile Vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities in mobile devices are a flaw in the operating system that makes the device vulnerable to attack. There are various reasons why Android and iOS mobile devices become vulnerable to threats. In particular, the fact that the Android operating system is more exposed to attacks is due to the fact that it is an open-source operating system. Neglecting to make regular updates, installing applications from official application stores or third-party stores without checking their authenticity cause security vulnerabilities. Victims can still be attacked, even if downloaded from protected stores such as the Apple Store and Google Play, as malicious hackers can place threatening code on the cover of a real app.

In 2020, 18,353 vulnerabilities were identified in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list. These record numbers are nearly four years in a row, more than triple the five years ago . According to the Synopsys Cybersecurity Research Center (CyRC) report, 97% of software and systems tested during 2020 were found to contain security vulnerabilities. Mobile devices are threatened by vulnerabilities in insecure data storage and communication. Of the vulnerabilities, 80% were related to insecure data storage and 53% were related to unsecured communication.

# 4. Security Solutions Against Mobile Malware and Threats
Today, with the increasing use of mobile devices, cybercriminals have begun to target mobile devices more than personal computers and laptops. A two-step method can be followed to protect mobile devices from malware and threats. First, preventive measures can be taken. Security measures should be taken to prevent attacks and malware infection on mobile devices. In the second stage, various tools can be used to detect the presence of malicious software.

The remainder of this section reviews techniques for detecting and blocking malware. It also offers some measures to minimize malware attacks.

# 4 Malware Detection Techniques
Techniques such as file access permission and sandboxing were applied to take security measures on Android and iOS mobile devices. However, they have been insufficient in preventing attacks that have recently increased and continue to increase.

Malicious attacks tripled from 2015, reaching over 8 million in 2016, causing more than $100 million in lost money worldwide . In 2020, SonicWall Capture Labs threat researchers recorded 5 billion malware attacks. This figure is a huge decrease compared to the previous year. However, this situation cannot be seen as a success. Because, with many people
# Multimedia Tools and Applications (2023) 82:20269–20281
starting to work from home, cyber security providers are gradually losing the ability to monitor traffic and potential attacks. So this number could be much higher.

# 4 Signature based techniques
The signature-based technique is a technique for detecting and identifying certain patterns of malware, called signatures. The way of work this type of method is explained as follows: Generates a new signature by comparing a newly defined signature with existing signatures in the database. The downside of this technique is that if malware developers make minor changes to the new version of their app, the signature won’t work. The comparison of the signature is made by overlapping.
