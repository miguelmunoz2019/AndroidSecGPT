# ABSTRACT
Recent advances in hardware and telecommunications have enabled the development of low cost mobile devices equipped with a variety of sensors. As a result, new functionalities, empowered by emerging mobile platforms, allow millions of applications to take advantage of vast amounts of data. Following this trend, mobile health applications collect users health-related information to help them better comprehend their health status and to promote their overall wellbeing. Nevertheless, health-related information is by nature and by law deemed sensitive and, therefore, its adequate protection is of substantial importance. In this paper we provide an in-depth security and privacy analysis of some of the most popular freeware mobile health applications. We have performed both static and dynamic analysis of selected mobile health applications, along with tailored testing of each application’s functionalities. Long term analyses of the life cycle of the reviewed apps and our general data protection regulation compliance auditing procedure are unique features of the present paper. Our findings reveal that the majority of the analyzed applications do not follow well-known practices and guidelines, not even legal restrictions imposed by contemporary data protection regulations, thus jeopardizing the privacy of millions of users.

# I. INTRODUCTION
Even though enforcing security and privacy requirements in mobile apps is admittedly not an easily achievable task , when sensitive data are at stake one would expect m-health applications to follow well-known security and privacy guidelines and legally binding data protection provisions to guarantee data privacy and safety. However, many popular apps (not only m-health apps), which process sensitive data often fail to provide even basic protection to users’ privacy due to either inappropriate implementations or poor design choices –.

In this article we investigate user’s privacy exposure in m-health apps that, as they handle sensitive personal data, are expected to be equipped with data protection mechanisms. Due to the Android’s Operating System (OS) popularity, we decided to test Android apps retrieved from Google Play. We have selected the apps according to quality, popularity and content-related criteria. Furthermore, we have studied the spread of users’ personal data and, mainly, the final parties receiving these data. In our in-depth analysis we have...

evaluated 20 popular m-health apps in terms of their provided data security and privacy. We have come to the alarming conclusion that the majority of the analyzed apps does not meet the expected standards for security and privacy, thus endangering their users’ sensitive personal data.

Our study is innovative and has unique features with respect to previous articles in this area. We provide an analysis of security and privacy concerns in m-health apps through long term evaluation, monitoring and recording of the full life cycle of the apps (from January 2016 to August 2017), assessing the quality of all communication channels. Moreover, we investigate the way that app developers responded to the security reports we submitted them. Finally, we perform a GDPR compliance auditing procedure to determine whether the reviewed apps conform to the new EU legal requirements.

The rest of the article is structured as follows: First, in §II we provide the reader with background information and related work in the field of m-health security and privacy. Next, in §III we describe and justify our data collection and assessment methodologies. Further, in §IV we report and analyze the results of our research. Finally, the paper concludes in §V by briefly discussing the impact of our findings and by pointing out some of the necessary mitigation strategies. For the sake of completeness we include some explanations on personal data protection terminology in Appendix.

# II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
Over the last few years we have witnessed a mobile computing outburst and its progressive adoption in people’s daily activities. A whole new software market of mobile apps is flourishing with each mobile OS vendor willing to have its own independent marketplace. Undoubtedly, one of the most popular software categories within these on-line stores is that of ‘‘health and well-being’’ and, developers and publishers are increasingly populating the m-health apps market.

There is an emerging shift towards the ‘‘connected health’’ model , where the goal is to achieve flexible, effective and affordable healthcare services by following the notion of the context-aware smart health (s-health) paradigm . In this technological context, while many devices share common OS platforms, mobile apps are frequently considered to be part of the IoT ecosystem ,  and, hence, they may potentially suffer from similar shortcomings. Yet, a growing number of healthcare professionals are shifting towards the use of mobile apps to better communicate with and manage the health information of their patients. Convenience, better clinical decision making, improved accuracy, increased efficiency and enhanced productivity  are some of the benefits that mobile apps provide to health professionals. As a result, there is an increased interest for mobile accessible Personal Health Records (mPHRs) that allow healthcare providers to better share information with patients.

This noticeable growth of the m-health market, nonetheless, comes along with a growing concern for the security and privacy readiness of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, wearables) and their installed apps. A report of the European Commission about citizens’ data protection within the 28 EU Members States  affirms that over half of the respondents in 16 of the surveyed countries stated that they were concerned about the recording of their everyday activities via mobile phone use or mobile applications. Responding to people’s worries about the inadequate and fuzzy protection of their personal data in the era of ubiquitous computing, the European Commission adopted in 2016 a new stringent legal framework for protecting individuals’ personal data, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  which will replace the existing 1995’s Data Protection Directive  and will become directly applicable to all EU Member States on May 2018, harmonizing thus the various national regulations across the EU. The GDPR enforces new legal requirements to data controllers operating within the EU territory and foresees severe sanctions for compliance failure to its provisions regarding personal, and specially sensitive, data protection. Although, the regulation provoked prolonged controversy and intense discussions regarding its applicability in the age of big data and the IoT , it anticipates for some radical changes in the data protection regime - among others, the introduction of pseudonymisation and the data portability right.

Yet, concerns about m-health applications are not restricted within the EU domain. On the other side of the Atlantic for instance, there is a lot of skepticism about the applicability of the national US standards of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) that defines policies, procedures and guidelines for maintaining the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. Notably, some scholars argue that m-health apps fail to be aligned with the regulatory protection of the HIPAA.

The fast growing market of m-health apps fostered an emerging interest in studying the security and privacy impact on users. In  20 apps (both Android and iOS) were evaluated in terms of their security by identifying possible risks and desirable features, based on eight analysis criteria, with the aim to assist users in selecting m-health apps. In  an m-health threat analysis comprising possible attack scenarios was presented. The analysis, which revealed the security and privacy vulnerabilities of 154 selected diabetes and hypertension apps, was based on four axes: a static analysis applied to all apps, a dynamic analysis applied only to the 72 most frequently downloaded, an assessment of web server’s security and, a privacy policy inspection applied to 20 of the selected apps. Additionally, in  Knorr et al. summarized their findings for the top 20 downloaded apps with a score based on the identified privacy and security issues.
