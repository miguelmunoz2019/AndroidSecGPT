# V. Experimental analysis
In order to verify the effectiveness of the vulnerability mining method, 290 applications were downloaded from third-party application markets for experimental verification. The application scan engine is developed in Python, and dynamic analysis is performed through a USB connection for real machine testing. The test platform is Huawei P20. Common types of security vulnerabilities were selected for verification in the experiments. The experimental results were compared with static analysis methods, and the final detection accuracy was judged by manual analysis. The experimental results are shown in Table I.

# Table I. Experimental results
It can be seen from the experimental results that compared with the static analysis method, this method can improve the vulnerability detection rate for security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, Webview remote code execution, allow backup vulnerabilities, and Shared Preferences storage risk.

one hand, due to the case of shell reinforcement in Android application, the automatic static analysis tool failed to reverse decompile, which led to the failure of further feature matching, resulting in a high rate of false positives. On the other hand, the static analysis method could not simulate the actual application running environment, resulting in a high rate of false positives in some vulnerabilities detection.

# VI. CONCLUSIONS
The paper designs and implements a dynamic and static vulnerability mining engine for the android platform. From the perspective of combining static analysis and dynamic analysis, the security issues of Android platform applications are mined. The experiment proves that the stability and availability of the system can be maintained under a large number of samples, the scanning task can be completed in a short time, and the false positives rate can be kept at a low level. The next step is to optimize the application of reverse analysis technology and expand the scope of application of analysis framework..
