# Standards and Frameworks
# 1) Common Criteria
Common Criteria (CC) is now an international standards framework (ISO/IEC 15408) for certifications in computer security. It originated from a combination of regulations and standards mainly from three places, TCSEC – US DOD NIST , CTCPEC – Canada & US, and ITSEC – European standards from the early 1990s. CC is a standard that “provides a common set of requirements for security functionality of IT products [such as hardware, software, and/or firmware] and for assurance measures applied to these IT products during a security evaluation” . Moreover, CC introduces two specifications, which contribute to CC’s flexibility in usage: Security Targets (STs) and Protection Profiles (PPs). ST and PP specifications allow creation of a high-level of abstraction guideline that define threats, problems, and security requirements. These specifications are not meant to have detailed description or a long description of detail operation. For this reason, CC encourages readers to use other security standards in conjunction for a more effective way to manage risks and facilitate future security evaluations by the organizations.

Vendors who certify products using Common Criteria assure that these products went through a strict standard process of specification and evaluation. These are high quality guarantees from these certified products. CC is used as a base for government certification. The Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement is an international agreement made up of Common Criteria and Common Methodology for IT Security Evaluation (CEM), respectively. Each country uses their own processes to certify, and member countries certifications are acknowledged after they have been evaluated by a collaborative Protection Panel (cPP). Goals include to improve security enhanced products and their availability, and ensure that these evaluations are done to the highest standards consistently. Each product evaluation results in an Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) between 1 and 7. Lastly, the guidance of operation section provides examples of tests and guidance in developing tests that can be tailored for an IT product.

# 2) The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)
TOGAF® is a “proven Enterprise Architecture methodology and framework … to improve business efficiency”. TOGAF® focuses on architecture definition for large-scale interconnected enterprise systems, addressing business, data, application, and technology domains . TOGAF®’s 30-page document, “Integrating Risk and Security within a TOGAF® Enterprise Architecture” , lists security concerns corresponding to each of the four different domains and provides guidance for risk management.

# 3) Software Assurance Forum for Excellence in Code (SAFECode)
The practices defined in SAFECode cover a wide variety of the software industry needs with the intention to be implemented into organizations’ SDL . Practices that SAFECode focuses on are in the areas of design, coding, and testing. SAFECode enhances the practices by providing methods and tools for organizations to receive guidance and feedback. They also have Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) references to strengthen security discussions, descriptions, identification, and implementation.

# 4) Application Security Verification Standards (OWASP ASVS)
OWASP Open Web Application Security Project foundation is a non-profit organization that supplies developers with current standards for secure coding practices. OWASP’s ASVS is an open community security standard used to normalize security controls during software requirements, design, development, and testing . For requirements, an activity checklist supports the following security verification levels: level 1 is meant for all software, level 2 is for applications that contain sensitive data, and level 3 is for the most critical applications. A quick reference guide gives users detailed actions to take during the development and coding processes of building an application. This standard also has a list of testing tools: OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) for both Android and iOS is a security model listing security requirements, and a base template for setting up automated testing for mobile applications. Included is a set of insecure apps called a Hacking Playground that demonstrates the vulnerabilities they discuss.

# C. Standards Institutes
Standards institutes tend to focus on specific industries that have detailed security needs. These needs impact software development in security requirements and testing.

# 1) National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a department of the US government that has a very large set of regulations, guidelines, and rules about software development and security, that are continually updated and published. There are vast amounts of free documents that are guidelines of best practices that are used for integrated control systems (ICS), which include supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), distributed control systems (DCS), as well as many other areas of industry. These systems are found in such industries as oil, gas, chemical, electric, water, transportation, wastewater, pulp & paper, food and beverage, and manufacturing. These document best practices to securing these systems. They also identify known threats, review system topologies & architectures, and give countermeasures to address these situations. There are regulations (e.g., FISMA) and specific guidelines that companies, vendors, and anyone doing business with the US government must comply and adhere to.

# 2) ISO/IEC
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) are committees responsible for developing, promoting, and maintaining standards worldwide for industry, particularly communications and information technologies as well as sets and govern the standards for electric and electronics. While many of these standards documents cost a fee, some may be downloaded for free at.

# a) ISO/IEC 15026-2:2011
The standard ISO/IEC 15026-2:2011 is part of the 15026 family of standards, and defines the methodology to develop an assurance case for systems and software, which is one or more claim(s) about that product supported by evidence, reasoning and justification . Assurance cases are used to support the claims in areas such as its software security, reliability, operability, and safety.

They may also be referred to a specific named case e.g., instructional and training documentation, in areas including reliability case, maintainability case. This standard is reviewed every five years and provides an overview about the elements and requirements needed to develop an assurance case and its components such as claim, coverage, argument characteristics, evidence, associated assumptions, and justifications that are required. Assurance cases are an important part of the software and systems engineering. An assurance case can also be applied to safety or security of a software product.

b) ISO/IEC 41062: This standard helps those that are acquiring software for their organization. It is a recommended practice and comprehensive standard for software acquisition, that describes current best practices for acquiring software systems that are available e.g., software as a service (SaaS), off-the-shelf (OTS) software, and custom-developed software. Eight steps and twelve checklists are outlined with detailed actions for acquiring quality software including a planning and acquisition strategy, preparing contract requirements, selecting software vendors, and providing assurances such as software safety and software information security assurances.

# IV. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
Table II and III contrast the stages covered by each standard, as well as the risk management support for each.

# A. Developing Processes
The two evaluated maturity models are similar in some of the activities they present. SAMM and BSIMM models have a very effective way to measure progress. As shown in Table 2, both models have a heavy focus on risk assessment through the activities that are required  . For instance, abuse cases are activities recommended in both models that are easy to develop, demonstrate how attacks affect the software, and aid to create a more well-rounded risk assessment. Moreover, both models require activities to create threat models for the specific application and technology. Lastly, the multi-step process in these standards allow organizations to start at low level and reach higher maturity levels using a step-by-step approach with a focus on process improvement.

# B. Mature Processes
The NIST and ISO standards provide extensive documentation for mature organizations or severe applications. NIST is often compared to ISO 27001, the framework for information security management systems, because of their similarities. Both NIST and ISO publications follow a strict structure. ISOs numbering system refers to a base number as a "family" of documents containing sub-documents related to specific areas these policies should be integrated into. Each publication number and sub-number contains extensive documentation and procedural steps to take for each stage of the project's development lifecycle. ISO is more risk focused while NIST focuses more on security.
