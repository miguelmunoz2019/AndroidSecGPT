In the future, our research work will focus on the following directions: On the one hand, we will investigate more impact related metrics, for example, the economic loss caused by the malware, to directly reflect the impact of Android malware. Besides, we may collaborate with security corporations or labs to obtain more accurate and trusted metrics values. On the other hand, we will collect more Android malware samples from other sources to update the created dataset in this paper. Whatâ€™s more, more advanced and informative features, e.g., graph based features (FCG, CFG), tree based features (abstract syntax tree), will be introduced to accurately capture the impact characteristics of Android malware.
