The results of this study show that privacy awareness moderates the effect of perceived privacy risk on the perceived security of mobile apps. Investing time and money into elevating users’ awareness through different methods (such as privacy policies) would always help in preventing security incidents and unwanted privacy disclosures. There are benefits for companies in raising users’ awareness, such as contributing to the creation of a safer and more secure business economy, which is beneficial to both businesses and customers. The results have shown that there is a significant difference in the effect of privacy policies on privacy risk in more sensitive and less sensitive contexts. This shows that, if the privacy policies for more sensitive mobile apps (i.e., mobile banking apps) address the security strategies and preventive measures in place, users perceive fewer risks, compared to less sensitive mobile apps. App developers should provide more information about data collection and protective measures in more sensitive apps, because this affects user perceptions of privacy risks.

# 6. Limitations
The results of this study should be viewed in light of its limitations. First, although the findings generally support the hypotheses, this study did not extend the model to include the outcomes of perceived security that could be translated into variables, such as intention to use. We encourage future researchers to go beyond the proposed model by integrating other privacy (e.g., privacy control and privacy experiences; Smith et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2011) and security-related variables (e.g., perceived threat severity and perceived threat vulnerability; Bélanger, Collignon, Enget, & Negangard, 2017), and even extend the model by involving other outcome variables deemed suitable.

Both samples collected for this study were limited to one method – a questionnaire survey. Even though the use of two groups increased the generalizability of the findings, existing method studies emphasize triangulation and the use of multiple methods (Orlikowski & Baroudi, 1991). Survey data has potential issues, such as common method bias and high measurement errors (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003; Straub et al., 2004). We addressed the common method bias, but there are other data sources (i.e., archival data) that are less prone to such issues and biases. This study did not have access to such sources, but we encourage future researchers to look for other sources, such as log data, to better predict the security behavior of app users.

# 7. Conclusion
This paper addressed the following research question: do privacy perceptions impact users’ perceptions of mobile apps’ security? Unlike the prior literature, which only tested the effect of privacy on security or vice versa, this study examined the effect of privacy antecedents on users’ security perceptions. More specifically, this paper examined whether privacy risk and the effectiveness of privacy policies, two antecedents of privacy concerns, affect the perceived security of mobile apps. The empirical results of this study suggest that the antecedents of privacy directly affect users’ perceptions of security. Both boundary rule formation and boundary coordination and turbulence affect users’ perceptions of security. The results show that privacy awareness moderates the effect of perceived privacy risk on perceived security. This study found that the effectiveness of privacy policies (boundary coordination and turbulence) affects privacy risk (boundary rule formation). Thus, this paper has provided some initial insights into the effects of the antecedents of privacy concerns on the perceived security of mobile apps. We hope that this paper can motivate future investigations into the complex effects of privacy on security, while testing whether the antecedents of these constructs affect each other.
