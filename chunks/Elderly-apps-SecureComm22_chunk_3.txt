# 4 Results
Following the methodology in Sec. 3, we tested 146 Android apps for elderly people, between October 2020 and December 2021. For dynamic analysis, we ran the apps on a Samsung Galaxy M02 (SM-M022G) phone with Android 10. We report our findings in this section, with an overview of the top 30/146 apps with the most security and privacy issues in Table 1.

# 4 Improper Authentication Management
We found that 15/146 apps have authentication management vulnerabilities. Prominent examples include the following: In Empowerji, 40 Plus Senior Dating,

# Privacy Analysis of Android Apps for the Elderly
GoldenApp, EZ Care, FlirtMatures Dating, POC EVV and Cougar Dating, the login credentials are sent in plaintext over HTTP, so any on-path attacker sniffing the traffic can get the user login credentials (e.g., Empowerji leaks name, email ID, password and phone number; POC EVV leaks the 6-digit user ID, a 4-digit PIN for login and the private messages sent between the caregiver and his/her supervisor). For All Well Senior Care, Seniority and Tricella Health, we successfully performed an OTP brute-force attack (on our test account). This is possible as these apps do not implement any rate limiting and the OTPs consist of 4 or less numerical digits, which can easily be enumerated (even for the worst-case scenario, where we could easily try all 10000 requests for a 4-digit number); we also verified that full account takeover by a remote attacker takes only trivial efforts. In All Well Senior Care, the attacker can obtain the user’s health data (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, etc.), wellness data (wake up time, steps taken, etc.), see all the hourly updates the user is providing to her caregiver, the location of the user, all the health charts which are saved on the user’s account, and even the private messages of the user with their caregiver or their care group (containing multiple users in one group). Wherein user information (e.g., address, phone numbers, credit card details) can be obtained in the Seniority app due to improper authentication management. During our retesting, we also noticed that Senior Safety App fixed its issues in a software update.

# 4 Insecure Session Management
We found 10/146 apps that had their session IDs sent in plaintext over HTTP. For example, POC EVV exposes its session ID in plaintext over HTTP, so an on-path attacker can replay a request from this app and perform an account takeover. Also, 8/146 apps did not use any authentication secret. For example, GoldenApp does not make use of any authentication secret for accessing any resource (which also leads to improper access control issues which is explained further in Sec. 4). The app’s authorization mechanism is purely based on supplying a mobile number, where there is no verification from the server’s end regarding which mobile number is tied to which user. An adversary can change the mobile number from the request and log into the replaced number’s account. Although the victim’s number is not leaked anywhere, an on-path attacker can still see the mobile number as the communications are over HTTP. For our testing, we used only our own test phone numbers. After changing the number, the attacker can impersonate the victim, e.g., to request home services on the user’s behalf. Apps like FlirtMatures Dating send their session IDs in plaintext over HTTP; any on-path attacker can sniff these secrets, and potentially takeover a user’s account, also allowing the attacker to access user’s sensitive information.

# 4 PII Exposure, Data Sharing with Third-parties and Trackers
We found that 16/146 apps send plaintext PII to their servers. Examples include: POC EVV (login code, login PIN, session ID during login), 40 Plus Senior Dating (email ID and password during login), Empowerji (full name, email ID,

password, mobile number and city), GoldenApp (username, mobile number, user address), and EZ Care (username and password during login and the private messages sent and received between a doctor and the user).

Moreover, out of the 16 apps that send plaintext PII to their own servers, 6 of them also send PII in plaintext over HTTP to third-party domains/trackers. Examples include: Oscar Senior (email ID, user name and profile picture sent to googleapis, and geolocation to onesignal’s API endpoint), Big Launcher (exact geolocation to openweathermap.org), Carelinx (email ID to intercom.com), 40 Plus Senior Dating (email ID, user name and profile picture sent to googleapis), Senior Dating (user name and password sent to googleapis).

18/146 apps send device information and usage data in plaintext (6/146 over HTTP and 12/146 over HTTPS) to third-party domains. The most common parameters include phone model and OS build version. Empowerji sends CPU build, Android version and firmware version to AppsFlyer (third-party domain). Homage, EZ Care and All Well Senior Care send WiFi, cellular information, signal strength, and a flag to check if the device is rooted or not. Seniority sends email ID, device information (phone model and OS build), and the product details (that the user adds to the shopping cart or buys on the app) to a third-party analytics tracker (wzrkt.com) over HTTPS.

We found that 115/146 apps communicate with 341 third-party (non-tracker) domains: 66 apps communicate with Googleapis.com domains, 43 apps with Firebase sub-domains and 29 apps with Facebook domains. 72/146 apps had traffic through at least one Google domain. We found 39 unique tracker domains with 137 occurrences across 76/146 apps (see Table 2). The top 3 prevalent trackers are Crashlytics (35/146), DoubleClick (22/146) and Google Syndication (12/146). Crashlytics is a crash reporting software that helps identify bugs in the apps and report the user’s activity to the app developers so they can take appropriate action.

A domain is considered to be a third-party domain if an app from a developer connects to it to enable third-party functions. Thus, the domain certificate owner is not the same as the developer of the app.

priate measures to ensure that users do not stop using their app. DoubleClick is a Google ad service. In 9 apps, we detect 10 or more third-party domains and trackers (Senior Discounts, Big Keyboard & Notifications, Free Chat & Senior Dating, Senior Dating by Lauber, Over 40 - Find People 50, 40 Plus Senior Dating, NeuroNation, Ianacare, Oscar Senior). These apps could expose elderly users to potential voluminous in-app advertisements, and extensive tracking.

# 4 Improper Access Control
We found 4/146 apps with improper access control. GoldenApp’s access control issues are due to insecure session management. As there are no authentication tokens or cookies in the requests, an attacker can replay the requests (even modify them) to create accounts in other users’ names which can lead to misrepresentation or identity theft for the user. POC EVV contains a 5-digit “dcsId” parameter as the user ID in the requests which can be changed (by a remote attacker) to get other users’ data (e.g., phone number, home and office address, zip code). Senior Discounts plus Coupons has a 6-digit parameter for the user ID that can be modified to get any other user’s email ID. Damava also has a similar issue where an attacker can fetch the user details using a GraphQL query and then modify the user ID to get other users’ data (e.g., email ID, address, criminal record). The information disclosed in Damava could result in a full account takeover for both the patient as well as a caregiver. We also found that the appointment details query and mutation do not implement any access control in Damava; an adversary can view, modify and cancel any elderly patient’s appointment. Moreover, given the appointment and caregiver details, the attacker can also impersonate a caregiver to harm the patient.
