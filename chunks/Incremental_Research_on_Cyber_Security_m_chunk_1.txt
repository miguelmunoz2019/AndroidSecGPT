# Abstract
Cyber attacks are prevailing to be a great headache for the technical advancements especially when dealt with mobile usage in an android application environment. For a new user, it is difficult to identify the set of harmful permissions. This could be an advantage for malware intruders to access the data or infect the mobile device by introducing malware applications. Thus the face of Cybersecurity has changed in recent times with the advent of new technologies such as the Cloud, the internet of things, mobile/wireless, and wearable technology. The technological advances in data science which help develop contemporary cybersecurity solutions are storage, computing, and behavior. In this paper, the possible investigations are done on the cyber attacks in android by adopting the various malware classification and detection techniques. Various Classifications and Detections are done on various malware prevailing in the android applications.

# 1. Introduction
Smartphones are becoming more popular devices for many people. Due to the rapid entry of smartphones, malware has been spreading widely. An Android OS-based system, being the most popular platform for mobile devices therefore it becomes easy for attackers to target them. Many attackers and hackers take advantage of the lack of security standards and limited capabilities in handheld devices. As a result, it paved the way for the attackers to steal the personal information of the users of Android mobile devices. From the year 2011, the malware attacks were increased by 155 percent across all platforms. In particular, the handheld devices (using Android OS) are the platform with the highest malware growth rate by the end of 2014. Android phones have been sold more than 60% of overall smartphones available Android possessed 82% of the market share in 2015 reported in the global survey of the OS smartphone market, implying that the growth of the Android is increased when compared to other OS. Today The Android platform is the fastest growing market and faces some critical risk.

The rapid growth in computer science and information technology in recent times has led to the generation of a massive amount of data. As a result, these issues to be considered include optimization, uncertainty quantification, systems theory, statistics, and types of model development. Malware poses significant threats to the cybersecurity of national infrastructures, service sectors, and ultimately the society as a whole. As a result, malware attacks have extended to mobile devices and it has become a necessity to protect ourselves from such attacks. Traditional signature-

Based and change-based malware detection methods are not able to cope with new types of malware attacks. To address this problem, in this research project, we plan to develop a practical and effective "anomaly-based" malware detection system with an emphasis on a mobile computing platform. We carry out the generation of system metrics (i.e., feature vector) and a variety of efficient machine learning techniques to curtail the malware intrusion in smart devices.

A fundamental requirement of hybrid techniques is training and testing on a large dataset, which can lead to improved accuracy. However, existing techniques for machine learning-based approaches suffer from low accuracy and high false-positive rate (FPR). Also, these techniques have been tested on small datasets. With the emergence of big data  and the increasing number of malware patterns , machine learning-based malware detection techniques must be compared and tested on a large dataset to obtain high accuracy and low FPR. In this paper, we are motivated to improve Android malware detection techniques using big data analytics. Conventional fixed algorithms (hard-wired logic on decision-making level) have become ineffective against combating dynamically evolving cyber-attacks. This is why we need innovative approaches such as applying methods of applying Machine Learning algorithms and Artificial Intelligence (AI) that provide flexibility and learning capability to software which will assist humans in fighting cyber crimes as AI offers this and various other possibilities.

Numerous nature-inspired computing methods of AI (such as Computational Intelligence, Neural Networks, Intelligent Agents, Artificial Immune Systems, Machine Learning, Data Mining, Pattern Recognition, Fuzzy Logic, Heuristics, etc.) have been increasingly playing an important role in cybercrime detection and prevention. AI enables us to design autonomic computing solutions capable of adapting to their context of use, using the methods of self-management, self-tuning, self-configuration, self-diagnosis, and self-healing when it comes to the future of information security. To this end, we provide a comparison of seven different ML classifiers on the dataset - Using 55 GB dataset and a 19-node Spark cluster, we compared different classifiers including Isotonic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Multilayer Perception. We observed that in general, tree-based techniques provide better results.

# 2. Background
Early detection is the most important thing to mitigate the harmful effects of malware. Throughout the years, many malware detection methods have been proposed. These can be broadly categorized into signature-based, change-based, and anomaly-based methods.

1. Signature-based methods: A signature-based intrusion method detects malware based on its signature. It first gathers data and analyzes it, and when a program or file has a similar signature to an already existing malware (which it compares to from a database) it detects it. This method is often used for detecting popular malware signatures, but it can be quite slow since it should compare the signatures from a large database, meaning it cannot be instant.

2. Change-based methods: Change based detection is a method that identifies when changes occurred in the system. It relies on probability distribution to detect the changes. These techniques include online and offline change detection techniques.

3. Anomaly-based methods: "In the anomaly-based system, a system administrator defines the baseline, or normal state of the network's traffic load, breakdown, protocol, and typical packet size. The anomaly detector monitors network segments to compare their state to the normal baseline and look for anomalies" . Up until now, virtually almost all real-world deployments of malware detection (like virus scanners) are signature-based and change-based methods. Though efficient, these methods are not able to identify new types of malware (such as those carrying out zero-day attacks).

Some research has been done on anomaly-based malware detection, which is good at identifying new malware. However, so far the anomaly-based methods are not widely deployed yet because of practical issues such as efficiency/scalability, high false-positive rate, difficulty to use, etc. Our research objective is to fill in this research gap and propose a practical and effective implementation of Malware classification and malware detection method by adopting the Machine learning algorithms embedded with artificial intelligence, especially in the new and emerging area of mobile computing.

Crowdroid  also used anomaly-based detection, however, their methods were somewhat different. Crowdroid used two types of datasets, one they developed for testing and the other from real malware. The research concluded that detecting malware through monitoring system calls would work for emerging and new malicious software. Aung and Zaw  proposed a model which first uses feature selection then applies k-means, next classifies the dataset using RF and J48 and finally analyzes it.

BPS Vignesh and Rajesh Babu  proposed a model wherein various machine learning algorithms and SVM are adopted to classify the malware and to ensure the reliability of the software by checking the permissions obtained from the end-user of android applications.

RiskRanker used a method called zero-day detection, in which it checks through applications in the Android Market to determine which may be risky. This way the system narrows down the “potential risks”. There are two order modules that RiskRanker follows, the "first-order module handles non-obfuscated apps by evaluating the risks". Brenner (2010) argues that "most of the cybercrime we see today simply represents the migration of real-world crime to cyberspace which becomes the tool criminals use to commit old crimes in new ways.

ScanDroid , which examined the data flows of the Android application to determine if it is benign or not. One of the main aspects of these scans is checking the permissions of the app, as well as the certifications. Like RiskRanker, ScanDroid should detect malware as soon as it is installed on the system. Shabtai et al.  proposed a host-based malware detection system called Andromaly, that inspects the set of features such as, outgoing and incoming communication statistics.
