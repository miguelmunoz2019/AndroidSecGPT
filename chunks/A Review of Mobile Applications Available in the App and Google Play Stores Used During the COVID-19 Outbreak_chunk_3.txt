# Technologies for Tracking
Similar to Tawakkalna, this app uses Bluetooth technology for communicating with nearby devices and it uses GPS to track the user’s location in relation to other smartphone users who have registered as infected and are using the same application. This app also provides additional functions such as self-assessment tests, test reporting, e-permits for travel, COVID-19 related information, information about precautionary methods, online consultations, etc. The app has alerted more than 1 million users about the possible risk of contamination and it has helped to generate 697 coronavirus hotspots in the country. However, in relation to the use of the data, some privacy concerns were raised, such as information collection, purpose limitation, data storage, institutional divergence, lack of legislation, transparency and auditability. The government subsequently addressed these concerns, and the app is currently being used by the majority.

# TraceTogether App
TraceTogether is a contact-tracing mobile application launched by the Singapore government. Similar to the Aarogya Setu application, this app uses Bluetooth technology to identify when a user is in close proximity to an infected person, and it accordingly alerts the user. This app uses anonymous IDs, which are exchanged between smartphones with TraceTogether installed. Privacy and security were given utmost importance when designing the application. The Bluetooth data stored in the smartphones are automatically deleted after 25 days. In addition, the users have the right to delete the data, ensuring high levels of privacy.

# COVID Safe App
About the COVID Safe application, it is a contact-tracing mobile application launched by the Australian Department of Health. It is the only contact app approved by the Australian government. The purpose of the application is to track the movement of people and to identify whether they have come into close contact with infected people. If they do, the app alerts them. In addition, the health officials will contact and provide the support and information needed. Users can register using a pseudonym in order to protect their identity, and they also give their mobile number. The app should be running in the background. It uses Bluetooth technology for communicating (using digital handshake) with other devices that have installed the COVID Safe application. Information such as date, time and contact numbers is securely encrypted and stored on the phone for 21 days; after this time the users can delete the data. Also, the data stored in the National COVID Safe Data store will be destroyed at the end of the pandemic.

# Immuni App
With regard to Immuni it is a contact-tracing app launched by the Italian government in June 2020. This app is similar to other contact-tracing apps; it alerts users if they come into close contact with a person using the same app who has been registered as infected. The unique feature of the application is that it uses Bluetooth low energy technology, ensuring low power utilization. In addition, the application does not collect any personal details such as name, date of birth, address, telephone number, or email address. If two smartphone users with the Immuni app installed come into close contact, their smartphones automatically exchange generated codes. This makes it possible for the application to trace previous contacts if one of the users is diagnosed with the virus. Later, the code is entered into the centralized system by the health authorities with the consent of the patients, and this system is used to alert all other users who have come into close contact (using the code). In addition, the application possesses a multi-language feature, enabling people of different nationalities to use the application in Italy. The application does not track movements and it only shares the codes for contact tracing. Any data collected and shared with the central server will be deleted by December 31st, 2020.

# COVID Symptom Study App
The COVID Symptom Study application was developed by the researchers at King’s College London Guys, St Thomas’ Hospitals, and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company. The purpose of this application is to analyse the spread of the virus, identifying high-risk areas in the UK, assessing vulnerable sections of society, and understanding the symptoms linked to underlying health conditions. This app does not provide any information or health advice, but it is intended to collect data from people in order to promote the research related to COVID-19 in the UK, so that better preventive actions can be taken. People can voluntarily participate in the study, and share two types of information on a daily basis. The first part is related to general information, such as age, health information, and any underlying conditions; and the second part is related to the symptoms. More than 4 million people across the UK are voluntarily contributing data to the application, and this has helped to create an.

# NHS COVID-19 App
The NHS COVID-19 app was launched by NHS Test and Trace, UK. The app uses Bluetooth low energy technology along with GPS to track the movement of users. This app serves various purposes. Firstly, it alerts a user if they have come into close contact with other registered app users who have tested positive for COVID-19. Secondly, it allows users to report symptoms and book a free test for COVID-19. Thirdly, if users check into a place or venue, it informs them whether a high number of positive cases have been listed there. Fourthly, it allows users to keep track of their self-isolation countdown and to access relevant advice. The app does not store any personal information that can identify a user. However, information such as location tracking, postcode, venue check-in, etc., is collected for track and trace purposes.

# COVID Watch App
Concerning the COVID watch application (USA), it was developed by the University of Arizona, supported by the Arizona Department of Health Services. The application is currently being used in the university, and the plan is to roll it out in phases across Arizona. The purpose of the application is to alert users if they come into close contact with any registered infected person using the app. The app uses Bluetooth technology and does not use location tracking. In addition, it does not collect any personal information that can identify the user. The unique feature of the application is that any party or authority could not track who has been informed, and it was one of the first applications to launch an open-source specification.

# PathCheck App
Finally, the PathCheck application (USA) is a contact-tracing application developed by MIT and TripleBlind, who collaborated to form a newly created non-profit organisation called PathCheck Foundation. The purpose of the application is to integrate both people and health departments in an effort to contain the spread of novel coronavirus by sharing information. The application uses Google Apple Exposure Notification API, which ensures privacy and security for the users’ data. The users can store their private location and symptom diaries on their phone. Various health departments are integrated with the app, and the users can select any preferred department to share information and receive services. The goal of PathCheck is to encourage the re-emergence and re-opening of economies and communities.

# Discussion
The results of this study related to the applications that were launched and updated during the COVID-19 outbreak for the management of COVID-19 in several countries show that 12 free applications available in the App and Google play stores were launched and supported by the governments and health institutions of India, USA, Saudi Arabia, Italy, UK, Singapore, and Australia. The accessible applications that met the inclusion criteria were: Mawid (Saudi Arabia), Tabaud (Saudi Arabia), Tawakkalna (Saudi Arabia), Sehha (Saudi Arabia), Aarogya Setu (India), TraceTogether (Singapore), COVID Safe (Australia), Immuni (Italia), COVID Symptom Study (UK), NHS COVID-19 (UK), COVID watch (USA), and PathCheck (USA).
