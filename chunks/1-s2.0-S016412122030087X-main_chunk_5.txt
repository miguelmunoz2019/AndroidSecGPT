Information security has been widely studied. Privacy, such as identity privacy (Li and Shen, 2013; Li et al., 2018b) or search privacy , has also been a research topic. Li and Shen (2013) proposed an effective rank-based attack model and algorithms for rank anonymization and hypergraph reconstruction, in the aim to privacy preserving for hypergraph-based data publishing. Li et al. (2019a) showed various privacy problems in forward and backward security model and proposed efficient algorithms to solve the problem for pattern privacy leakage. Outliers can be regarded as anomalies or even intrusions. There exist related work focusing on machine learning methods to detect outliers or anomalies in streaming data. Zhang (2018) reviewed state-of-the-art techniques for extracting representation and discovering knowledge from streaming and temporal data where outliers or anomalies exist. In Particular, they proposed novel models such as KDE-Track  and StrAP (Zhang et al., 2008; 2014) to effectively detect outliers. Smart contracts can be regarded as applications that are run on Blockchain. We have designed ContractWard  to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts. While these work lies in the broad range of information security, the most related work includes security and privacy in Android ecosystems, and Android SSL/TLS vulnerability analysis.

# 7. Security & privacy in android ecosystems
Improper implementation of SSL/TLS leads to security problems such as users’ privacy leakage. In our previous work , we analyzed the malicious behavior in Android apps with machine learning methods. We constructed some common classifiers to detect malapps. Our method achieved the accuracy of 99% in the detection of malapps and achieved the best accuracy of 82% in the categorization of benign apps. We also detected malicious software with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) . The accuracy with our models was improved by 5% compared with SVM. We also analyzed the privacy leakage of third-party libraries . We evaluated 150 popular apps and collected 1909 privacy information related call chains. We found that the third-party libraries access to privacy information accounted for the largest proportion. We also proposed an automated community detection method  for Android malapps by building a relation graph based on their static features. Our method outperformed the traditional clustering methods and achieved the best performance with rand statistic of 94% and accuracy of 79%. Earlier, we studied the permission risk  of Android apps. We built a malapp detectors on risky permissions and the detection rates are 94% with a false positive rate as 0%. We also detected the malware after extracting the different features of apps and Android platforms . Privacy leakage is an important issue in Android ecosystem. We studied the privacy leakage of sensors in Android apps . We developed a tool called “SDF-Droid” to identify the used sensors types and generate the sensor data propagation graphs in each app. We found that some third-party libraries registered all the types of sensors recklessly. Li et al. detected Inter-Component privacy leaks in Android apps  and studied malicious code grafting systematically . Dong et al. (2018) developed a tool called “FraudDroid” to detect AD fraud automatically for Android Apps and found 335 cases in 12,000 apps. Li et al. (2018a) proposed a novel solution for the detection of Android malware based on a machine learn-
# 7. Android SSL/TLS vulnerability analysis
In 2012, Fahl et al. (2012) first raised the problem of Android SSL/TLS vulnerabilities and developed a static analysis tool called MalloDroid to detect their vulnerabilities. They found that 8% of apps had this problem. The authors further manually analyzed 100 of these apps and found that 41 of them had this problem. The weakness of their method is that it requires manual analysis to confirm the vulnerabilities. Brubaker et al. (2014) studied certificate validation logic. They mainly carried out large-scale certificate validation tests on the server and found many vulnerabilities in browsers and SSL/TLS libraries. Sounthiraraj et al. (2014) developed a tool called SMV-HUNTER that introduced automated analysis of Android apps on this problem. However, they only analyzed the original Android apps and did not cover the hybrid web apps. Liu et al. (2018c) aimed at SSL/TLS error-handling vulnerability in hybrid web apps. They only considered one type of vulnerable code. All these methods aimed at a specific kind of Android apps. The vulnerabilities detected are not comprehensive enough. In addition, they start Activity directly in the process of detection, which may lead to application crash. Gao et al. (2018) studied vulnerability evolution on Android apps and found that the vulnerabilities’ fix cycle of the risk is very long.

# 8. Conclusion
In this work, we propose an effective method and develop a tool called “DCDroid” to identify the vulnerabilities in the implementation of SSL/TLS digital certificate verification in Android system. We analyze 960 apps from Google Play and 1253 apps from 360app with DCDroid. Extensive experimental results show that with initial static analysis, 457 (20%) apps contain potential security risks in the implementation of SSL/TLS and with further dynamic analysis 245 (11%) out of 2213 apps are finally identified as vulnerable to MITM and phishing attacks. DCDroid also analyzes the characteristics of vulnerable apps, including their categories and version evolution. Comprehensive experimental results and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DCDroid in the detection of SSL/TLS certificate verification vulnerabilities in Android apps. In the future work, we are designing mechanisms to automatically patch the vulnerabilities found with DCDroid.
