can be employed by developers to include fingerprint recognition in their apps. Goode Intelligence predicts that 3 billion users will use biometric systems on their mobile devices by 2018 (Yldrm and Varol, 2014). Mobile fingerprint technology has been used in different mobile applications that mainly focus on authenticating users, such as phone lock, mobile payment, and mobile banking (Yldrm and Varol, 2014) . Fingerprint in mobile devices encompasses several advantages; it is a fast authentication model, it is entirely accepted in mobile devices, and it provides competitive performance rate . However, deploying biometrics in mobile devices faces several challenges such as limited computation power, small storage capacity, and finite battery life. The algorithm used in traditional biometrics systems needs to be simplified to adapt to small CPU processing power of mobile phones. The essential simplicity might reduce the accuracy and security level, which will affect the performance of mobile-enabled biometric techniques . Besides, authors in  have shown how the inappropriate usage patterns of the fingerprint API in most Android apps such as Google Play Store and Square Cash can make these apps vulnerable to several attacks. Another challenge is how to maintain safe storage of biometrics data in the device. Growing biometrics databases carry with them expanding worries about the likelihood of theft or misuse of individuals’ biometrics. To preserve the privacy of biometric technology users, biometric data must be efficiently secured during storage in a database.

Other security solutions for saving sensitive data on Android mobiles are cloud-based or remote server-based which require a working network, as this makes the accessibility of the stored contents depends on the network. Also, there is a possibility of user data getting disclosed, if the cloud storage or the remote server database gets compromised.

# 5. Conclusion
The literature exposes a set of identified threats on Android data storage, along with solutions to mitigate the risk and improve the security. We can deduce that users can influence the security of the data either by deciding to root the device, which is a risky process, or by disabling the FDE option. Besides, the developer influences the security of the data by building legitimate vulnerable apps, or by building malware apps that can access sensitive data. Cryptography is the primary defense against data disclosure; it is highly recommended to encrypt data on the device. Android provides two types of encryption systems, FDE and KeyChain that use password-based encryption method and depend on user’s passcode. Choosing a strong lock screen passcode is a critical issue, but requiring the user to type encryption password every time to unlock the screen, renders it unlikely to choose a secure password. Moreover, security of conventional cryptographic techniques relies on the assumption that only a legitimate user knows the cryptographic keys, hence, maintaining the secrecy of keys is a big challenge. In the password-based encryption method, the key is vulnerable to offline brute force attack when the encrypted key stored in the device . An attacker who gains physical possession of the smartphone can extract the data and mount an offline attack, trying passcodes until one is found that produces a key, which decrypts the data successfully . Moreover, it is dangerous to depend on user’s passwords since it can be easily lost, stolen, forgotten, or guessed. Thus, how to protect data on mobile devices against software and physical attacks, is still a significant and urgent problem. A promising solution would be to use biometric cryptosystem to protect the storage of the encryption key in the device. Biometric cryptosystem substitutes password-based encryption method; the user is not prompting to enter a password, s/he is requested to present his/her biometric template instead. It can be used to secure data against software attacks since data is encrypted, and against physical attacks because the cryptographic key is never stored in the device, only an auxiliary data will be stored.

As a future work, we will investigate the threats and vulnerabilities of using biometrics for authentication and data encryption on Android. Besides, Android is continuously updated, and new versions are published endlessly. New versions might prevent some of the vulnerabilities discussed in this survey and open others. Thus, Android security and its threats should continuously be investigated.
