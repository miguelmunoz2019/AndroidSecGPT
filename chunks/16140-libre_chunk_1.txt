# ABSTRACT
Applications within mobile devices, although useful and entertaining, come with security risks to private information stored within the device such as name, address, and date of birth. Standards, frameworks, models, and metrics have been proposed and implemented to combat these security vulnerabilities, but they remain to persist today. In this review, we discuss the risk calculation of android applications which is used to determine the overall security of an application. Besides, we also present and discuss the permission-based access control models that can be used to evaluate application access to user data. The study also focuses on examining the predictive analysis of security risks using machine learning. We conduct a comprehensive review of the leading studies accomplished on investigating the vulnerabilities of the applications for the Android mobile platform. The review examines various well-known vulnerabilities prediction models and highlights the sources of the vulnerabilities, prediction technique, applications and the performance of these models. Some models and frameworks prove to be promising but there is still much more research needed to be done regarding security for Android applications.

# 1. INTRODUCTION
Mobile devices are very popular today and play a critical role in the everyday lives of most humans. The majority of these devices are so useful because they contain android applications-. In most cases, these applications require sensitive personal information such as name, address, and date of birth. Security vulnerabilities in these applications can be catastrophic to the users. To combat these vulnerabilities, we must perform a thorough analysis and make or utilize a model to foresee these vulnerabilities. In this literature review, we will explore a few security measures that have been used to do just that. The first measure or model that we decided to conduct more research on was risk calculations, which should be used to determine how secure an application is. The second measure we decided to explore was access control, for this metric we decided to dive deep into things such as permission-based access and healthcare applications where user privacy is even more critical. The last measure we chose to review is predictive analysis, we knew that there has been a huge increase in the popularity of machine learning and artificial intelligence. We came

to know that this could be very beneficial to finding security vulnerabilities and allowing us to enjoy our apps without fear of cyberattacks.

There have been many studies focused on security metrics for Android Mobile applications as a result of the recent increase of research interest in the area of Android smartphone security. Gonzalez et al.  investigated string offset order, a new easy-to-extract function. They were able to recognize the symptoms of reverse-designed Android applications using their tool, which did not require any further research. They used datasets from the Android Malware Genome Project, Droid Analytics, and Drebin to test the String Order metric's capabilities. In addition, over 5,000 Android applications were retrieved from the Google Play Store, and over 80,000 samples from the Virus Total service were analysed on a wide scale. In a comprehensive review of some repackaging exploration techniques. Offline and web technologies are the two basic forms of technology. They each have their feature. A technology that is used offline cannot be replaced by a tool that is used online and vice versa. Offline technologies are for the smartphone store owner's direct use, while online technologies are for Android users' direct use. We investigate a variety of online and online-related technology. These technologies describe a subset of technologies that use various features and metrics to discover application similarities -.

The research conducted by Ordoñez-Ordoñez et al.  examines the reliability of mobile banking applications from both the inside and out. The authors used blog mining as a research method to comb through blog posts about mobile banking app protection. Security threats, assurance protocols/best practices, and potential security patterns are outlined to assist banks and customers in reducing the security risks involved with a range of financial applications. A study presented by Zheng et al.  looked at numerous security vulnerabilities in Android portable applications, especially for sensitive applications, and concentrated on analysing popular security attacks on cell phone applications. Preliminary studies to determine the feasibility and complexity of applying security attacks to the vital mobile mission application, finding current solutions and research holes, and recommending research directions Using numerous hacking methods and tactics, we successfully conducted three repackaging attacks to obtain access to victim files. We evaluate the extent of risk and recommend technological mitigation by evaluating these scenarios. The research carried out by Khokhlov and Reznik  describes information protection and quality assessment approach based on a probabilistic assessment of disruptive behaviours that exploit Android operating system features and bugs in the same way that installed apps can. It depicts the Android OS engineering functionality associated with protection and major security tools. The paper demonstrates the measurements chosen for information security assessment and the approach developed to combine them, resulting in an overall security evaluation score that addresses sensor-based information dependability. The count of instances of the total security assessment ranking is added and dissected.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 elaborates the risk value calculation of applications in the marketplace. The discussion encompasses elucidating the vulnerabilities of the major changes to the Android permission system and describing the levels of threat based on the given score. In section 3, the access control security in Android applications has been presented and examined. A description of the mobile app development affected by access control vulnerabilities has been given. Furthermore, various access control metrics that are used to assess the risk of access control functionality in mobile applications are elaborated. Several frameworks that could be utilised to moderate data access for mobile application development are also explained. The predictive analysis to combat security vulnerabilities is demonstrated in section 4. The discussion includes describing the security mechanisms that have evolved with millions of applications in the past, as well as innovative technologies that could offer more sophisticated security. The conclusion is depicted in the final section, section 5.
