Since the assessment of apps in these dimensions involved some subjective judgments, the first two authors assessed the 10 APPGs individually. For any disagreement at the table, they discussed and agreed on the same answer, and if the disagreement persisted, a third author joined the discussion to facilitate a resolution. As shown in Table 2, the level of Complexity is positively associated with the level of Extent of Data Use, Customizability, and User Instruction. Most of the APPGs (8/10) exhibit complete publishing support. As for compliance with privacy regulations, more than half the APPGs (6/10) claim that their privacy policies conform to the GDPR and CCPA, and only #1 Iubenda claims compliance with LGPD. Only #1 Iubenda supports generating privacy policies in languages other than English. All APPGs’ readability scores are between 30 and 50, which indicates that readers should have at least a college-level education background to easily read the policies . #2 App Privacy Policy Generator has the highest readability score and is the most frequently used APPG on the current market, as discussed in Section 3.

# 2 Extent of Data Use Recognised by APPGs
In this section, we further investigate the extent of data, data use, and data practices recognised by APPGs to support the generation of privacy policies. We identified four major aspects: the app’s basic information, users’ personal information, device permissions, and third-party services. We carefully gathered all the possible questions and potential options that APPG users might face. If any question or option explicitly pertains to a specific data type, permission, or third-party service, then it is classified as “recognised” ( ), otherwise “absent” (#). The specific item enumeration process is available at.

App’s basic information. Apart from user names, providing at least one communication channel to app users.

The first row of each section is the number of APPGs as per Table 1. “Multiple-choice questions” refers to whether developers select options from listed items, and “Completion questions” means developers fill in blanks with plain text. (Selecting a date is also regarded as a completion question.) Since some questions sometimes unlock later questions, we use “Minimum” and “Maximum” to reflect the lower and upper bounds. *If date of birth is included in the APPG, then we consider that Age group can be inferred.

for any potential inquiries is commonly required by privacy protection and regulation laws, and all the APPGs support this with different levels of granularity.

Users personal information. We manually separate this into two sub-categories: general personal information, and sensitive personal information. Most APPGs recognise general personal information, and only some APPGs (3/10) explicitly identify sensitive information.

Device permissions. According to the Android developer’s guide , there are nine dangerous permission groups, namely CALENDAR, CAMERA, CONTACTS, LOCATION, MICROPHONE, PHONE, SENSORS, SMS, and STORAGE, on mobile phones. We expect the collection and use of data related to these permissions to be clearly declared in a privacy policy, therefore, they are set as row indices. We found that more than half of the APPGs (6/10) recognise CAMERA, CONTACTS, and LOCATION, and only two APPGs identify all permissions. Failing to correctly state sensor permissions in the privacy policy could lead to serious privacy issues, so we further investigated whether users can correctly utilise the APPG to state all claimed sensor permissions in Section 4.

Third-party services. Third-party services have become a significant part of mobile apps. Taking into account the diversity of service providers and their popularity, we selected five third-party services as row indices, as most APPGs either fully or partially cover them. Overall, APPGs show decent coverage among these third-party services.

Statistic summary. We counted the completion questions and multi-choice questions (examples are illustrated in Figure 1) that users would encounter for the questionnaire-mode APPGs. Although questions may vary dramatically, we take it as a quasi-indicator to approximately reflect users’ learning and time cost to use the APPGs.

As it involves intensive manual work, to avoid the effect caused by potential human error, we employ the same strategy as introduced in the previous section. Cohen’s Kappa  κ = 0 for the initial manual labelling, which is an almost perfect level of agreement. As shown in Table 3, #1, #3, and #8 are the best in terms of the recognised data use, they almost cover every data index listed in the table. #2, #4, #7, and #9 decently cover users’ general personal information and third-party services, but only a few or null users’ sensitive personal information and device permissions. #5, #6, and #10 merely cover some app’s basic information and failed to support the rest of the categories. Above all, users need to carefully select appropriate APPGs, otherwise, the unsupported data use will be missing in the generated privacy policy.

# Finding 1: APPGs are a handy solution for developers to draft privacy policies for their apps. They have various features, characterizations, and levels of recognition of data use.

# 3 Market Penetration of APPGs (RQ2)
The previous section carefully examined various characteristics of APPGs. In this section we consider the questions: How large is the APPG market? And are the seemingly more functional APPGs actually more popular in the market?
# 3 Status Quo of Mobile Apps’ Privacy Policy
Privacy policies play an essential role in mobile app ecosystems. An app without a privacy policy is not necessarily malicious, but developers are required to provide privacy policies due to regulations in some jurisdictions. These policies are also increasingly demanded by mobile app users and marketplaces. According to the Apple App Store Developers page , a privacy policy is required when submitting new apps or app updates: “By adding the following links on your product page, you can help users easily access your app’s privacy policy and manage their data in your app. Privacy Policy (Required): The URL to your publicly accessible privacy policy.” Additionally, in Google Play Console Help Center , developers “...must include a link to your privacy policy” to prepare the app for review. Although platform principles regulate the existence and quality of privacy policies, we still discovered some critical problems in the mobile apps market. Other forms of privacy notices, such as privacy nutrition labels (PNLs) , focus more on providing succinct information to end users, potentially sacrificing information relevant or required by specific regulations or marketplace requirements.

# 3 Crawled Privacy Policy Dataset
To better understand the status and quality of existing privacy policies, we need a large-scale privacy policy dataset. However, existing datasets suffer from various problems.

The differences between datasets for previous research and our research goals. Existing datasets are either not focused on mobile apps, biased, small, or outdated. First, some prior research focuses on privacy policies across all platforms, including websites and mobile apps , while we only target mobile apps. Since they did not include metadata (e.g., platforms) of the collected policies, we cannot filter them out from other platforms. Second, some research only focuses on apps of certain groups, and their collected datasets are not representative enough for apps in the market. For example, one study  manually collected 5,684 “globally popular apps.” This selection criterion leads to two critical problems: a) The top overall popular apps appear in a limited set of categories, such as Social and Finance, which can drive out apps from less popular categories such as Parenting or Libraries & Demo. b) These globally popular apps do not distribute evenly across various app categories, which may cause potential bias and unrepresentative findings. Third, some existing
datasets are small and can contain potential bias. For example, APP-350  only analysed 350 privacy policies, and another study  conducted fine-grained analysis on only 304 privacy policies. Finally, due to the rapid iteration of apps, apps’ privacy policies, and APPGs, some prior datasets can quickly become outdated. In summary, to make our findings comprehensive, generalizable, and up-to-date, we needed to collect a current large-scale dataset that can assemble apps of different popularity and from various app categories.

Google Play Store. Android mobile apps are often more transparent and friendly to academic research compared to iOS mobile apps . There are many app markets for the Android platform, but Google Play is the largest and the most accessible app market, with over two million apps, according to AppBrain . Thus, we only focus on it in this study. Some Android apps are specially designed for Android smartwatches instead of mobile phones; therefore, we intentionally excluded apps belonging to categories named Watch apps and Watch faces.
