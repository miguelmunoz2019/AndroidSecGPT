Commercial trackers. Commercial websites are heavily tracked by the top tech giants such as Google, Facebook. Both government websites and Android apps contain a significant number of such trackers; e.g., 17% of govt. sites and 37% of govt. apps contain Google trackers. Such commercial tracking is unexpected and may surprise many privacy-conscious users. Governments may want to engage citizens more actively by integrating social media resources on their websites, or attempt to understand their users’ needs through the use of commercial analytical services; however, exposing their users to commercial trackers should be taken more seriously. We found 10% of the analyzed privacy policies did not even mention the use of tracking services in the corresponding government sites. Government developers also need to be aware of privacy implications of using commercial JavaScript libraries and mobile SDKs, as user tracking is at the core of many of these libraries/SDKs. Clearing the browser history or the use of private browsing mode is not effective against fingerprinting attacks, which are actively being deployed to defeat cookie consent. Thus, third-party scripts should be analyzed to check for the presence of any fingerprinting APIs, especially if the APIs are session replay scripts (e.g., FullStory) should be avoided, or at least configured properly to reduce tracking and data exposure.

Out-sourcing app development. We found 19% (231/1166) apps were built by developers with non-government email addresses (137 with Gmail), indicating that at least some of these apps were developed by third-parties. Such out-sourcing may introduce the risk of leaking sensitive information, supply-chain attacks.

CDNs and foreign hosting providers. Many web services, including some government services, are adopting cloud platforms (e.g., Microsoft Azure) for scalability and cost reduction. We observed several government sites that supposedly deal with sensitive user information (e.g., election, police, courts, defence, immigration, airports) were hosted in a foreign country. Privacy policies of these government sites do not mention anything about such outsourcing. The use of foreign hosting providers and CDNs undermine the control of the hosted data; even if the backend databases remain at a government-owned facility, user data may still be (temporarily) available to the server admins of the CDNs/hosting providers, and violate data sovereignty. Although CDN hosting providers allow choosing a particular location to serve traffic, the closest location of the edge server/data center may not be within the country owning the site. There are many countries where CDNs have no data centers.

Malicious domains. Government sites and apps that are flagged as malicious, or include content from third parties (e.g., scripts, cookies) labelled as malicious, can harm users and diminish their trust. Unfortunately we found such malicious sites/apps on government services (304 government sites and 40 apps were flagged as malicious by VirusTotal). Governments should scan their websites/apps regularly to detect such domains.

App vulnerabilities. We found 7 government apps expose clear-text user login information, 11 apps include hard-coded (possibly admin) credentials and API keys, and 30 apps expose their unprotected Firebase datastores — all of which can enable attackers to harvest PII at a large scale. We strongly recommend developers to use HTTPS properly, not to rely on cloud-hosted mobile backends such as Google Firebase (exposing user data to commercial operators), and not to include admin API keys/credentials in the app code (possibly exposing user data to anyone). Security issues regarding the use of cloud-based mobile backends have been analyzed in recent work, and developers should check their apps and servers for similar issues.

# 7 CONCLUSION
Despite being publicly funded by tax payers money, government services enable commercial trackers to collect data about citizens virtually everywhere across the globe. From our analysis of 150,244 government websites and 1166 government Android apps, we found Google dominates in tracking, closely resembling the same trend as in the commercial domain, which is largely powered and monetized by tracking/profiling. A downside compared to commercial services is that users have no choice in terms of switching to another provider. Finally, since many governments continue to move to.

digital platforms, the relevant government authorities responsible to ensure privacy in each country/region should periodically review government websites and mobile apps for tracking, privacy and security exposures, at least to comply with their own legislation.

# REGIONS AND GOVERNMENT SITE COUNTS
We list the regions, and the count of government websites (in countries/territories of the corresponding regions) used in our study in Table 3.

Note that we crawled these sites from a VPN located in California. We also found website design companies serving governments (e.g., CivicPlus, Revize) included tracking scripts in government websites. In addition, 11 (2%) California government sites set cookies that are valid for 7984 years; see Table 7.

# TRACKERS ON EU AND CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT SITES
As more services are going digital, and many commercial entities’ments are apparently starting to take user privacy more seriously. They are also enacting regulations to impose significant penalties to commercial online service providers for the violation of data protection, tracking without consent, and failing to protect personal data.

Prominent regulations include: the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) , California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) , Protection Guidelines for Africa , Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA).
