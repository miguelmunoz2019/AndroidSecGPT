# VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
The permission system in Android applications enables applications from different developers to share data and resources with each other. This mutual interaction between applications based on permissions may cause security consequences, such as threats to secrecy and integrity of data. To capture safe data flows between Android applications, programming language-based security on Android has been formalized in mechanical theorem prover Coq. The formal system defined in Coq can effectively be used to study correctness (data-flow safety) of Android applications, modeled as simple terms. Furthermore, the language-based technique formalized in theorem prover enables mechanical support for creating and checking proof of correctness of applications as well as the language-based technique itself.

The formal model demonstrates theorem prover Coq, locally nameless representation and language-based security technique all together can be used to analyze the security provided by the model of the permission system and correctness of the technique itself. To make it more practical,

a software tool translating real Android applications to the logical formulas of the model would be more interesting. Moreover, the proof of soundness properties may be extended to other properties such as type safety and subject reduction.
