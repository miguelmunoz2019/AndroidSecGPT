The complex interplay of data within the BSADS framework serves as a prime illustration of the seamless collaboration among its various layers. Although the progression of data may seem to follow a linear pattern, it also demonstrates an intrinsic capacity for flexibility, enabling it to accommodate differences and adapt to particular applications. The aforementioned dynamic interaction not only serves to guarantee the security and integrity of data, but also facilitates a smooth and uninterrupted user experience. Fundamentally, the interconnections among the various levels can be metaphorically compared to a meticulously coordinated symphony, wherein each musical instrument assumes a crucial function in the composition of a harmonious entirety. Similar to the role of a conductor in guiding musicians to create harmonious music, the BSADS framework serves as a guiding framework for managing the flow of data in order to develop secure and efficient Android applications that incorporate blockchain functionalities. The success of the framework is rooted in the fundamental synergy that exists between its levels, which

# 4. User Interface (UI) Layer: Displaying Chat Messages
The UI Layer of the chatting application captures user input, displays chat messages, and facilitates the real-time display of messages in the chatroom. The UI Layer receives the updated chat history from the Application Logic Layer. It displays the chat messages, including both incoming and outgoing messages, to the user in a readable format. The user can view the chat history and continue interacting with the chatting application. Moreover, within the ever-changing realm of chat applications, it is imperative for the UI Layer to adjust in accordance with user preferences and accessibility needs. It is imperative to give precedence to designs that are both clean and user-friendly, while also ensuring support for multimedia messaging and incorporating accessibility elements. The use of a user-centric approach is essential for maintaining the competitiveness and inclusivity of the chat application, hence expanding its reach to a wider user base.

# 4. Application Logic Layer: Data Retrieval and Display
The Application Logic Layer validates user inputs, processes chat messages, and handles user authentication requests. If the user is not authenticated, it triggers the Identity Management Layer for verification. It validates the message to ensure it meets the required criteria (e.g., not empty, within character limits). The Application Logic Layer prepares the chat message for submission to the blockchain, which may include adding metadata such as timestamps or user identifiers. It retrieves the updated chat history from the Data Storage Layer in response to real-time updates or user queries. It processes the data and prepares it for display in the UI Layer.

# 4. Identity Management Layer: Signing and Verification
The Identity Management Layer verifies user identities using decentralized identity solutions, such as DIDs and cryptographic keys. The Identity Management Layer signs chat messages with the user’s private key to ensure message integrity. It may also verify the authenticity of received messages from other users using their public keys. Moreover, within the domain of identity management, the crucial factor lies in the ongoing improvement. The incorporation of biometric and multi-factor authentication methods, along with the adoption of evolving authentication standards, has the potential to enhance the robustness of user identity verification within the chat application, hence bolstering security measures.

# 4. Blockchain Interface Layer: Transaction Submission
The Blockchain Interface Layer receives the signed chat message from the Identity Management Layer. It communicates with the blockchain network using appropriate protocols (e.g., HTTP, WebSocket) and APIs. The Blockchain Interface Layer packages the chat message as a transaction and submits it to the blockchain for validation and inclusion in the blockchain. In the Blockchain Interface Layer, efficiency and compatibility are key. Using appropriate protocols and APIs, this layer should communicate with the blockchain network seamlessly. Developers should optimize transaction packaging and submission to reduce latency and resource usage to improve functionality. For effective transaction validation and inclusion, blockchain technologies and protocols must be updated. The Blockchain Interface Layer can speed up chat message submission to the blockchain network and ensure its timely validation and inclusion by focusing on these enhancements.

# 4. Blockchain Network Layer: Transaction Validation and Recording
The Blockchain Network Layer receives the submitted chat message transaction from the Blockchain Interface Layer, including user identities and signed chat messages. It
# 4. Data Storage Layer: Chat Message Storage
The Data Storage Layer is responsible for securely storing chat messages and user identity information on the blockchain. Chat messages are stored in blocks linked together to form an immutable and tamper-resistant chain. User identity information, such as cryptographic keys, is also securely recorded on the blockchain. This data flow demonstrates how chat messages are securely transmitted from the User Interface Layer to the Blockchain Network Layer for validation and storage. The use of blockchain technology ensures that chat messages are tamper-resistant, immutable, and transparent, enhancing the security and trustworthiness of the chatting application.

We are sure that the actual implementation may involve more complexity, depending on the chosen blockchain platform and specific requirements and limitations. This framework serves as a conceptual guide, designing the "best" model for the (BSADS) framework would depend on various factors, including the specific requirements, use cases, and constraints of the application. We suggested a high-level (generalized) architectural model that incorporates the main components of the BSADS framework and provides a robust and scalable solution.

# 4. Challenges and Optimization Techniques
While blockchain technology holds promise for various applications, there have been instances of unsuccessful implementations and notable challenges . Some unsuccessful examples include mobile voting projects that faced issues like low voter turnout, technical glitches, and security vulnerabilities, exemplified by West Virginia’s 2018 pilot criticized for lacking security and transparency due to reliance on a centralized server without end-to-end encryption . Ethereum Name Service (ENS) encountered scalability and performance challenges as the demand for domain names exceeded its capacity, causing delays and user difficulties . The Parity Wallet, a popular Ethereum wallet, suffered a critical vulnerability that allowed an attacker to freeze and lock users’ funds, eroding trust . Additionally, the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) hack in 2016 resulted in the theft of funds, leading to a hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain, highlighting vulnerabilities that can impact blockchain’s security and data integrity . These examples show that while blockchain can offer significant benefits for data storage, it is not a magic solution, and it is important to carefully consider the specific requirements and constraints of each app before deciding to use it. It is also important to note that there may be one successful implementation of blockchain in, e.g., voting systems, and at the same time there may be an unsuccessful one elsewhere; this highlights that programmers still lack the standardization for deploying the technology, and this has led us to consider how to suggest a solution to that issue.

The performance of blockchain-based data storage systems is limited by a number of factors, including the number of nodes in the network, the block size and the network bandwidth. These factors can lead to bottlenecks and delays in the processing of blockchain transactions . On the other hand, the scalability is also limited by a number of factors, including: the throughput of the underlying blockchain network, the size of the blockchain ledger and the consensus mechanism. These factors can limit the number of transactions that can be processed per unit of time. Performance and scalability are closely related because a system with good performance is more likely to be scalable since it can efficiently handle a higher volume of tasks or data without encountering bottlenecks or excessive.
