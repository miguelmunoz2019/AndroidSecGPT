Context: Human values such as inclusion, privacy, and accessibility need to be considered during software development to attract and maintain users. However, little effort has been made to study human values consideration in software development, particularly in software development artefacts.

Objective: Issue discussion is potentially a rich source for human values analysis because it is a common place for users and developers to share and communicate their concerns. This paper aims to investigate the extent to which human values are discussed and whether the presence of values differs across projects.

Method: We carried out a case study to discover human values in 1,097 issues collected from three Android projects: Signal, K-9, and Focus.

Results: We identified 20 value themes and proposed a contextualised software engineering description for each of them. The analysis shows that privacy, freedom, usability, and efficiency were the prevalent value themes in the issue discussions of these three projects. Meanwhile, Self-direction - Action and Security - Personal are the common prevalent human values found in the projects. Moreover, we found that a statement of values from the apps and their functionalities could contribute to the presence of values.

Conclusion: The results suggest that human values are present in software development artefacts, for which automated tools can be developed to extract and classify human values from them.

# 1. Introduction
As of September 2020, Google Play Store, one of the largest mobile application stores for Android, has more than 3 million applications . To stand out in the crowd, mobile application developers need to consider socio-technical factors besides the technical functionalities of their apps. For example, research in marketing sciences suggests that some factors such as emotional and epistemic values (e.g., curiosity, novelty, desire for knowledge) have a substantial effect on the intention to use an application . Other research indicated that security and familiarity significantly impact users’ trust towards installing a mobile application . Another study found that, among others, attractiveness, stability, cost, accuracy, and compatibility are the main factors that influence users to favour a mobile application . The factors influencing users’ decision to install and use mobile applications are similar to those formulated by social scientists as human values. Human values, or ‘something that people consider important in life’ , such as privacy or hedonism, are served as ‘criteria or standards used by a person to make a decision’ . In the context of mobile applications, a privacy-aware user may decide not to install or use an application if the application had a history of a privacy breach. The recent Facebook-Cambridge Analytica case is an example of how a breach of a human value (e.g., privacy) could affect users’ decision on using an application. In this particular case, a survey showed that 40% of the respondents said they are either stopped or used Facebook less than before.

To attract and maintain users, mobile application development communities must pay attention to human values. However, Mougouei et al.  argue it is difficult to incorporate human values into software development. This difficulty stems from, for example, the lack of understanding and contextualised software engineering definitions.

for human values. For this reason, we believe previous work on human values in software chose to use existing human value models from social sciences instead [9–14]. Unlike previous work, this study attempted to better understand human values in software by analysing a software development artefact as a place where human values can be discovered.

There is an idea from the literature that suggests technological artefacts could embody human values . In software engineering, this argument is supported in previous studies that used software development artefacts, such as issue trackers or commit messages, to investigate some values, such as privacy , security [18–21], accessibility , or energy efficiency . While their focuses could be related to human values, those works did not specifically discuss them as values. Furthermore, these studies are still limited to a specific set of values known in software engineering, leaving other remaining human values open for further investigation. These previous studies demonstrated that it is possible to discover human values in development artefacts. We chose issue discussion (or Issues in GitHub) among other development artefacts because through Issues, users and developers can communicate their feedback, problems, and concerns that they may have during software development1.

In this paper, we report a case study that collected 1,097 issue discussions from three open-source Android applications, Signal, K-9, and Focus, to measure the presence of values during software development and to propose contextualised software engineering descriptions for those values. We purposely selected these applications based on several criteria, including having a statement supporting some specific values, to increase the chance of discovering values. We then conducted a qualitative analysis to discover the presence of values in the issue discussions based on the definition that we developed in our pilot study. Based on the qualitative analysis of 1,097 issues consisting of 5,615 posts, 20 value themes were found. We also propose contextualised software engineering description for each value theme. Further, we observed that privacy, usability, efficiency, and freedom are commonly prevalent in all projects. However, our analysis reveals that the values statement and functionalities of the apps play a role in the presence of other value themes, particularly privacy, pleasure, and sense of belonging across projects. Our mapping of the value themes to Schwartz’s refined theory of basic values revealed seven out of 19 values can be found. Among them, Self-direction - Action and Security - Personal are commonly prevalent across projects.

Our main contributions in this paper are: (1) We identify 20 value themes in the issue discussions of three messaging apps and their mapping into Schwartz’s values, (2) We provide a contextualised software engineering description for each of the 20 discovered value themes, (3) We create a dataset of 1,097 annotated issues consisting of 5,615 posts and publish it  to be used by others to replicate, validate, or expand our study and develop potential automated values detection tools.

The remainder of the paper is organised as follow. Section 2 presents the theoretical background of this study. We outline our research questions and methodology in Section 3. Section 4 reports the results of our study. The discussions and reflections on the findings are discussed in Section 5. Section 6 describes threats to validity. Section 7 summarises related work. Finally, Section 8 concludes the paper and presents potential direction for future work.

feeling’  such that a threat or support to a value could respectively upset or excite people. For example, in the SE context, an app’s user in an issue discussion expressed his/her dislike when the app depends on Google Play Services. This particular user feels his independence being threatened by the possible changes of policies from the service provider, which is beyond the control of the app’s developers.

Human values have been studied extensively in social sciences resulting in several proposed models in recent decades. Fig. 1 shows the renowned human values models called Schwartz’s theory of basic values  and its refined version . In the earlier model, Schwartz categorised ten types of values (i.e., basic values), such as benevolence, stimulation, and universalism, along with their ‘exemplary specific values that primarily represent each value type’  or value items , such as privacy, freedom, and equality. In this model, human values are arranged in a circular manner such that supporting values are adjacent to each other while values that are conflicting are in the opposite direction . For example, pursuing freedom could introduce conflict to the value of respecting tradition. Fig. 1(a) shows the Schwartz original theory of basic values that consists of ten basic values (highlighted in black) and each of their corresponding value items. In the newer version of the model (Fig. 1(b)), the definition of values was refined, resulting in 19 basic values arranged similarly.
