Signature-based detection studies (cryptographic hash or package name) are used very often, but they are not successful enough. Malware and threats are constantly evolving and changing themselves to avoid detection by current security tests. Therefore, more machine learning algorithms should be used for detecting fake mobile applications and network monitoring in a timely manner. Testing for malware and threats should be performed dynamically using deep learning algorithms. For these tests to yield successful results, security companies must be more generous in making their malware datasets public. Otherwise, malware detection and recognition studies using smaller data samples may be insufficient.

Despite the increase in mobile malware and threats, corporate mobile usage has become widespread in recent years, with bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies. This spread accelerated as people started working from home due to the COVID-19 outbreak. This creates new opportunities for malware developers. Organizations that must employ a mobile-friendly workforce need to increase the necessary cyber security measures both to protect the personal data security of the employees and to protect the information belonging to the sensitive organization.

In the light of the current studies, and the mobile security reports, the future of mobile security can be focused on these sub-research areas and topics:
1. New signature-based techniques powered with machine learning-based techniques can be proposed,
2. New machine learning-based techniques that especially work with imbalanced network traffic datasets can be produced,
3. New classification algorithms can be presented that detect the malicious flow,
4. The storage of the sensitive user data can be secured with new techniques,
5. The Android market rules can be redesigned similarly to iOS market rules.
