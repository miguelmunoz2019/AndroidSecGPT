In the study related to android, the author in  stated that whereas the Android message passing system upholds the making of rich, interactive applications, it also brings about the likelihood for attack especially if developers do not take safety measures. Android Inter-application communication were examined and presented several classes of possible attacks on applications. Exiting transmission could put a mobile application at risk of transmission theft. On the other hand, incoming communication can put an application at risk of malicious doings and Transmission injection. A tool called comdroid can be used by most developers to analyze their own applications before they are released, by application reviewers to analyze applications in the Android Market, and by end users . This author analyzed 100 applications and proved the results by hand with 20 of those applications. Of the 20 applications, 12 applications were recognized with one susceptibility each. This shows that applications can be susceptible to attack and that developers should take extra precautions. Some vulnerabilities are due to user unfamiliarity of diverse settings that are present in android devices.

In a study on comparative investigation of several encryption algorithms for data transmission, the author in , analyzed the performance metrics of encryption algorithm bearing in mind the following factors like time to compute, memory utilized and number of Bytes output. The results from the simulation showed the comparison of three encryption techniques which are AES, DES and RSA with same text file for five experiments, number of Bytes output for AES and DES is identical for different text file sizes. It was noticed that the RSA has a very smaller number of Bytes output compared to AES and DES algorithm. The time taken by RSA is greater compared to the time taken by AES and DES. Based on the used text files and the simulation results obtained, it was settled that DES algorithm takes least encryption time and AES algorithm has least memory utilization while encryption time is very small in case of AES and DES algorithm. RSA takes the greatest encryption time and memory utilization is also very high but number of Bytes output is least when it comes to RSA algorithm. Additionally, the author in  gives a detailed study on symmetric key encryption such as DES, 3DES, AES, and Blowfish. It was resolved that private key encryption run faster than public key encryption techniques such as RSA etc. and the memory necessity of private key encryption is lesser than public key encryption algorithms. Furthermore, it was indicated that the security side of private key encryption is greater than public key encryption. Similarly, in  focused on two frequently used private key encryption such as Blowfish and AES. These methods were compared and their performance was assessed. The results from the investigations were given to establish the performance of these methods. In addition to that, this paper  provided a comprehensive performance comparison between four mostly used encryption techniques: DES, 3DES, AES, and Blowfish. The contrasts were carried out by running several different settings to process different sizes of information blocks in order to assess the algorithm’s encryption and decryption speed. The simulation setup was in C# programming language. The outcomes from this paper showed that blowfish is better in terms of performance when compared to the rest of encryption methods.

A study by  concluded that most symmetric algorithms have high encryption ration. Using A5 variations is better when developing Stream Cipher. In Asymmetric algorithm, RSA appears to be better whereas in symmetric algorithms AES appears to be better. The researcher further noted that Blowfish and RC variations were found to be susceptible in comparison to others, while Twofish and Threefish were found less secure in contrast to AES.

In another study by , two most extensively used symmetric encryption techniques were compared i.e. data encryption standard (DES) and advanced encryption standard (AES). The factors that were looked at were avalanche effect due to one bit variation in plaintext keeping the key unchanged, memory needed when implementing and simulation time necessary for encryption. The property of any encryption algorithm where a minimal change in either the key or the plaintext should give a noteworthy change in the cipher text is known as avalanche effect. AES has high avalanche effect compared to DES, whereas memory needed and simulation time for DES is greater than that of AES, which clearly represents that AES is better than DES. The ideal encryption technique for messages exchanged between objects through chat-channels, and is beneficial for objects that encompass monetary transactions is AES. It was stated by  that AES encryption is flexible and scalable and it is the fastest encryption method. AES is also easier implement. It was further explained by , that the needed memory for AES algorithm is less compared to other symmetric algorithms like DES, 3DES and blowfish. According to , The level of security in AES is very high because it uses 128, 192 or 256-bit key in the algorithm. The author in  indicated that AES displays resistance against a variety of attacks. Because of this, AES is a considered a highly protected encryption method. Apart from that, this paper  stated that AES has been designed to work swiftly and competently in both software and hardware and also cater for small devices such as smart phones. AES will offer extra security in the long run because of a large block size and a longer key that it uses. It was further stated by  that unlike other symmetric encryption methods, AES encryption algorithm has no weaknesses and limitations despite having a minimal storage space and high performance. On the other hand, this paper  presented the insights on Data Encryption Standard (DES), as one of the extensively recognized, openly available methods. According to  3DES was developed to address the identified faults in DES without forming the entire new cryptosystem. DES uses a 56-bit key which is not sufficient to encrypt sensitive information of users.

A study by  stated that 3DES makes use of a 3 key set in EDE (Encrypt-Decrypt-Encrypt) mode. In 3DES, the key length is extended by using the algorithm 3 times resulting in a key size of 168 bit long, which is 3 times of 56. A three 64 bit keys is used which are as follows K1, K2, K3. The K1 key is used for encrypting the data, K2 key is utilized to decrypt the data and the K3 key is used for again encrypt the data.

In a study by , it was settled that AES is faster and more proficient compared to other encryption methods. There is a minor difference in performance of several symmetric key methods when considering the transmission of data. Even in circumstances involving data transmission, AES would be appropriate especially in cases where the encrypted data is kept at the other end and decrypted several times. Another study by  discussed the key advantages of AES with respect to DES. It was indicated that AES can be easily implemented in high level or low level languages.

A study by  emphasizes the value of simulation for learning not only by using the model, but also by creating a model. How the creation process supports an understanding of models being representations of systems was also stressed.

# Research Design
When developing a model, there is need to meet a particular use and be as simple as possible. A simulation model is a structural model, what this means is that a model has logical and causal associations that happen in the systems. Simulation model development is an iterative procedure where a number of forms of a model are developed prior to attaining a usable model.

# Research Question
According to , it was stated that both Symmetric and Asymmetric Key algorithms are very much efficient in securing the transmitted information over any communication channels. The author highlighted the simple and proposed algorithms related to these cryptographic techniques. In Symmetric Key Cryptography, a single key is used for both encryption and decryption purposes. On the other hand, Asymmetric Key Cryptography uses two separate keys to prevent any unethical access to the data. The public key remains public and the private key is not shared. There is better security in this technique than the former. Moreover, Asymmetric Key Cryptography offers high information confidentiality and non-repudiation because of the use of Digital Signatures. However, Symmetric Key Cryptography is broadly used because of its straightforwardness.
