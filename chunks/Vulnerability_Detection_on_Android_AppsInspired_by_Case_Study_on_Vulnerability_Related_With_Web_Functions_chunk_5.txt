Li et al.  just conducted a detail analysis of the vulnerabilities that will occur in the music Apps. The music Apps that are analyzed mainly produce man-in-the-middle hijacking attacks when communicating with servers. Qian et al.  proposed a structure called app property graph (APG) for Android vulnerabilities. Based on this feature representation method, a detection tool is proposed for five common vulnerabilities. But they did not give workflows for the verification of the vulnerabilities. Chen et al.  manually analysed several OAuth providers for Apps and determined how differences between the Apps and browser environments lead to the OAuth vulnerability. Wu et al.  proposed a detection method for the confused deputy vulnerability in Android applications based on features of AndroidManifest.xml file and Control Flow Graph (CFG). Fang et al.  studied an input validation vulnerability in Android inter-component communication. This kind of vulnerability is caused by the incomplete security verification mechanism of Apps developers. Yang et al.  used a combination of static and dynamic methods to analyze the App’s dynamic loading vulnerability. This kind of vulnerability is caused by the insecure verification on the loaded executable file. Yang et al.  studied about security issues caused by mixed postMessage Origin Stripping Vulnerability (OSV) in Apps. Ranganath and Mitra  proposed a detection tool for supporting large-scale Android vulnerabilities; they didn’t conduct analysis method for vulnerabilities. Farhang et al.  focused on how different vendors deal with Android vulnerabilities.

Other studies explored different vulnerabilities from we studied. Feng and Shin  analyzed some vulnerabilities related to Binder in Android, and proposed an automated tool for detecting this type of vulnerabilities from the analysis of.

the causes of the vulnerabilities. Linares-Vásquez et al.  analyzed Android system vulnerabilities by using the Bulletin resource. Zhang et al.  mainly studied the Android system-level vulnerabilities. Through analysis rules and results, they proposed a detection tool for this type of vulnerabilities.

# VIII. CONCLUSIONS
We deeply analyzed the four kinds of vulnerabilities on a data set with more than 6000 Android Apps. The aforementioned vulnerabilities are ACOCDV, WRCEV, WBCVV and ICV. We found that webview and HTTPs are existed in most of finance and shopping apps. According to this, attackers can easily perform MITM. As for WRCEV which has been disclosed for a long time, it still exist in browser Apps, because developers lack the methods of vulnerability identification and security development awareness. Apps that use Alibaba Cloud OSS services, information leakage vulnerability of Alibaba cloud OSS credentials is caused by the weak secure awareness of developers. We developed a vulnerability detection tool, VulArcher. The experiments show that it can automatically detect the above vulnerabilities, and has good scalability.

One of vulnerabilities which VulArcher detected had been included in China National Vulnerability Database (CNVD) ID(CNVD-2017-23282). It detected more than 6000 Apps and found nearly 3000 Apps with the above vulnerabilities. and we have manually verified the accuracy of results among nearly 300 Apps. The source codes of VulArcher and sample data presented in this paper can be utilized by further researchers. We incentivize this by making our data publicly available.
