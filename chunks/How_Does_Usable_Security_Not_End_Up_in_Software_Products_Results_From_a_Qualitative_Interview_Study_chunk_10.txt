# Individually
1. Usability: What is usability for you in a software product?
2. Security: What role does security play in software development for you?
3. Usable Security: How do you think usability and security are related to each other?
# Case Example
# Usability
1. Have you ever implemented something that affected the usability of the product? (e. g., anything that changes the UI)
2. Can you tell me a little bit about the background of the product and feature you have implemented?
3. How did you make your decision about usability? Can you walk me through the process?
4. Did the specification you were given cover usability aspects?
5. Were you given any specific usability criteria to meet (when would the software be “usable enough”)?
6. Who did you assign usability tasks to? Did you assign the role of “usability champion” to any team member?
7. Did you consult other team members, or other usability resources in the company, at any stage?
8. Did you consult any external usability resources – literature, design guidelines – at any point?
9. What were the specific usability goals/requirements for this project?
10. Were any usability assessments (e. g., heuristic evaluation, user test) carried out during the project?
11. Did you know exactly who the users are and how they behave with the product?
12. How do you handle usability bugs?
13. Was usability directly or indirectly part of your goals within your contract?
14. What role does usability play for your team?
15. What usability knowledge and skills does the team have?
16. How many of you previously worked on a project with usability requirements?
17. How many of you had usability training in this company, or in a previous position?
18. How important was it for the company that software delivered is usable? What are the consequences if it is not?
19. How well do you think this company delivers usability, compared to other companies you know?
20. How does the company deliver usability?
21. How does the organization define usability?
22. Can you give me some more background information to this company?
# Security
1. Have you ever implemented something that affected the security of the product? (e. g., login field, network interface, some API which used cryptographic functions)
2. Can you tell me a little bit about the background of the product and feature you have implemented?
3. How did you make your decision about security? Can you walk me through the process?
4. Did the specification you were given cover security aspects? For instance, was a risk/threat analysis provided? Were security mechanisms specified?
5. Were you given any specific security criteria to meet (when would the software be “usable enough”)?
6. Who did you assign security tasks to? Did you assign the role of “security champion” to any team member?
7. Did you consult other team members, or other security resources in the company, at any stage?
8. What were the specific security goals/requirements for this project?
9. Were any security assessments (e. g., code walkthrough, pen testing) carried out during the project?
10. How do you select an API for security purposes?
11. How do you deal with security bugs?
12. Was security directly or indirectly part of your goals within your contract?
13. How do members of the team define security?
14. What security knowledge and skills did the team have?
15. How many of you previously worked on a project with significant security requirements?
16. How many of you had security training in this company, or in a previous position?
17. How important is it for the company that software delivered is secure? What are the consequences if it is not?
18. How does the organization deliver secure software?
19. How well do you think this company delivers usability, compared to other companies you know?
20. How does the organization define security?
21. How well does the software delivered by the organization meet security goals, compared to other organizations?
22. Can you give me some more background information of this company?
# Usable Security
1. Did you personally have to deal with conflicting usability and security requirements at any stage?
2. Can you tell me a little bit about the background of the product and conflict you dealt with?
3. When you look at all your projects in the past, how many of them had bad usable security requirements?
4. Did you consult any internal or external resources – colleagues, developer forum – to help you solve the problem? If so, what information was helpful to you?
5. Do you follow a particular software development process? If so, how would you describe it? And how easy is it to deliver usable security as part of this process?
6. Did you consult any internal or external resources – colleagues, external experts, developer forum – to help you achieve usable security in the project? If so, what information was helpful to you?
7. Were there specific goals for usability of the security mechanisms in the software?
8. How important is it for the company to deliver usable security? What are the consequences if it is not?
9. What does the company do to ensure it does deliver usable security? Who in the company has responsibility for this?.
