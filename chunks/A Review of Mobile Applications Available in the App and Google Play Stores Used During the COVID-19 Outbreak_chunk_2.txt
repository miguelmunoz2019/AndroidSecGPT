# Features and Functionalities of the Mobile Applications
# Description of the Applications
# Mawid App
The Mawid application is a central appointment system provided by the Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia. The application can be used by patients to book, change and reschedule their appointments, and also for managing their referral appointments, across 2400 primary care centres in Saudi Arabia. Using the GPS and the maps feature enabled in the application, patients can view the primary care centres nearest to their location. They can select any primary care centre and book appointments at their convenience. The application also alerts the user if an earlier slot for an appointment is available, which can help patients if they require an early appointment. The application is enabled with the self-assessment feature for COVID-19, and it offers a consultation window to the public. Patients need to enter information such as their travel history and symptoms, and answer other relevant questions in the application for the self-assessment test. At its launch in May 2019, the application was integrated in 98% of hospitals and primary care centres, and linked to more than 6 million registered users. The application has provided consultation services for more than half a million people and more than 250,000 self-assessment tests have been recorded since the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia. Although initially developed as part of a promotion of digital health, the Mawid application has been very effective in delivering healthcare services during the COVID-19 outbreak.

# Tabaud App
In relation to the Tabaud application, it was developed to achieve health and safety goals by controlling the COVID-19 outbreak and limiting the spread of novel coronavirus, in order to ease the restrictions on social and business activities in Saudi Arabia. The application is mainly designed for contact tracing, as it notifies users when they come into close contact with other registered infected persons using the same application. This application uses Google Apple API for contact tracing, which strictly protects the privacy and security of the users. Accordingly, the application does not use location mapping, but it relies on Bluetooth technology for detecting any nearby smartphones using the same application. If a user updates their status in the application as infected, this information is then sent to the Ministry of Health for confirmation. If the information is confirmed by the ministry, then all smartphone users with the Tabaud application who have been close to the infected person during the 14-day period prior to the infection will receive a notification to take the necessary precautions. In addition, the application also analyses how close other smartphones were to the infected person, which helps to analyse vulnerability and the risk of contamination. In addition, it allows users to identify their risk of infection. However, the identity of the persons is hidden and anonymity is maintained by transferring the disguised identifier data of the person during communication with other smartphone applications, thus adopting stringent privacy policies. Over 15,000 positive cases have been reported by patients through the application.

# Alanzi
since its launch in June 2020. The application has been effective in contact tracing and limiting the spread of novel coronavirus.

The application also notifies the users if they are close to infectious or contaminated zones. It is a simulated version of a Chinese application that uses a colour-coded QR to reflect the situation of the user. Green shows that the person is healthy and has permission to travel. Yellow indicates that the person is suspected of having COVID-19 and is not allowed to move. Red indicates that the person is infected, is not allowed to travel, and needs to be in quarantine.

# Sehha App
The Sehha mobile application is one of the most innovative mobile health applications being used in Saudi Arabia. The application was developed for providing e-consultations through audio and video modes for users in the comfort of their own homes. The application employs AI technologies, enabling users to receive safe medical information, and enhancing the user’s experience during the consultation process. It also features a health assessment tool, where the users need to answer certain questions. Based on the responses, a health score is developed based on a disease or condition and the relevant feedback and precautions are prescribed. The Sehha app is similar to the Mawid app in terms of booking appointments, but it differs from Mawid as it facilitates an e-consultation process. Mawid provides consultations at primary care centres. The Sehha application was identified as being very useful during the COVID-19 outbreak, as it facilitated restrictions on movement.

# Aarogya Setu App
Regarding Aarogya Setu, it is an official mobile application launched by the government of India for tracking the COVID-19 outbreak, and restricting the spread of COVID-19. The application uses both GPS and Bluetooth.
