# Appendix C. Fingerprints derived from the protections
This appendix presents the fingerprints of the protections. We singularly present the protection atoms relevant to each protection and then the fingerprints. Note that in the fingerprints there are not protection atoms related to classes. We already include them in the detection of the methods and the attributes. In practice, detecting a method or an attribute of a class implies the presence of the class itself.
