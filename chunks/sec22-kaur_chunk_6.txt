Overall, MTurk participants reported the highest values for most security-related questions, suggesting it is easier to recruit developers there. This includes job role diversity, especially in security-related disciplines such as reverse engineering or vulnerability research, as well as years of security experience and their security knowledge confidence, which was rated with the SSD-SES. While MTurk looks promising, we encountered a high number of invalid and very similar answers, likely due to multi-accounting, in our initial run. This required us to redo the sample with an adjusted screening that included programming skill questions from Danilova et al. . We therefore recommend to use MTurk with caution and similar strict screening requirements to increase data quality. While we did not observe this problem on Prolific, we also could only rely on self-reported skill, and decided to redo this platform with the same screener. Future work should investigate our findings in more detail to better assess the recruitment of MTurk users for security development studies. As an alternative, Freelancer and Upwork participants also often reported high values (more than MTurk at some instances) on security-related questions. They are further viable options when researchers are trying to reach a diverse sample. On the other hand, we find students as well as Prolific participants to be less experienced with security, as they reported the least years of security experience, use security features least often, and had the lowest SSD-SES scores. We further found that participants who work in teams are more likely to have a security focus in their job or work on security-relevant tasks when compared to those who work alone. This is another pointer towards using platforms like MTurk, where comparatively more participants work in teams, to recruit security experts.

# Sample Diversity
While participant experiences, skills and knowledge are important aspects of recruitment, diversity of demographics might also be essential for research projects. In our survey, Google Play developers report the highest average age and the widest age range, correlating with their high number of working years. CS students are the youngest. Regarding gender, we find an overwhelming majority of male participants over all platforms, which is sadly usual in security research. Only on Prolific (26%) and in the student sample (20%) we found a comparatively high number of female participants. Regarding ethnicity, we found Freelancer and MTurk to be the most diverse, while Google Play and Prolific resulted in very euro-centric samples. We argue that due to these findings, MTurk and Freelancer offer the widest degree of diversity within their samples.

# 7 Specific Recruitment Strategies
# Crowdsourcing
The crowdsourcing platforms MTurk and Prolific offer a straightforward recruitment process. Although both did not offer screening opportunities besides pre-existing and potentially lacking filters, setting up additional screening surveys to find suitable participants is simple. However, we found cases of multi-accounting on MTurk that required us to use specific skill-based screening questions. On both the platforms, it is easy to quickly collect a large number of participants, but control over the sample is limited and dependent on the available filters, which can be insufficient when targeting a specific population. This can also lead to skewed populations, e.g. in case of the very euro-centric Prolific, or influenced by online trends . We recommend MTurk for larger studies with more participants where some noise (i.e. fraud) in the data could be acceptable. Studies with a smaller number of required participants should use platforms like Freelancer or Upwork, where the data is less likely to be noisy. Besides, the slower recruitment should be less of an issue for smaller studies, and researchers can gather more information about the participantsâ€™ experience via their profiles.

# Freelancers
It was more complex to create job postings on Freelancer and Upwork, as these platforms are tailored towards recruiting only a few freelancers for more complex practical tasks such as programming a website, leading to comparatively high minimum wages per job of $10 or $5. Therefore, we needed to provide more information in the setup process about both the job, and our expectations for participants, but were able to directly communicate and sufficiently filter for qualified participants. However, this led to some users trying to bargain with us which was much more time-consuming than the crowdsourcing platforms. On Upwork, it was possible to include screening questions into the job post. Between the two, we found recruiting on Upwork to be less complex and more intuitive, as well as having benefits such as easier and faster payment options. Additionally, we received only two applications on Freelancer, which forced us to manually contact participants. Therefore, we specifically recommend Upwork to recruit experienced developers for practical coding studies or similarly larger tasks.

# Email Invites
We contacted both Google Play developers and students via email. While CS students can be reached using university mailing lists, access to these cannot be taken for granted for all research institutions or unaffiliated researchers. Although we only used public contact information from Google Play, the common practice of harvesting email addresses from GitHub commits is a legal gray area that researchers should be aware of . Additionally, we found that many developer addresses are inactive or lead to ticket systems that might never reach a developer. Overall, distributing a survey via email is the fastest and cheapest, but also offers the worst response rates. As there is no platform for handling payments, offering compensation is more complex. Finally, sending unsolicited email invites is increasingly perceived as spam and the collection and use of non-public contact information is inhibited by emerging privacy laws such as the GDPR in the EU.

# Key Points | Recruitment Advice
Developers were present on all platforms. Google Play developers are the most experienced, but focused on Java and Android. Students are less experienced than other platforms. While there are developers on Prolific, they are less experienced in security topics. Crowdsourcing platforms should only be used with filtering via screening questions, especially MTurk. Freelancing platforms require a lot of manual work and are more expensive. While emails are cheaper, they have low response rates.

# 8 Conclusion
In this work, we first identified common recruitment strategies for user studies with participants with software development experience. We extracted relevant survey questions from these papers, and designed and tested a questionnaire to study the general and security programming, knowledge, skills, and experience of participants. Finally, we surveyed 706 participants across six samples, and provide detailed insights into their survey responses. Overall, we found that participants across samples varied significantly, and that the characteristics of different recruitment strategies highly influenced their suitability for different study types. In future work, more recruitment platforms we excluded in our work should be investigated for a broader picture of viable recruitment methods for security development studies. Similarly, future work could investigate developer samples with a different focus such as system administrators or security engineers. Finally, while we found that MTurk participants self-reported high overall and security experience, skills and knowledge at most instances, this particular finding should be further investigated.
