# 5. Evaluation And Result Discussion
# 5 System Evaluation
The system evaluation is used to measure the quality of an application that refers to efficiency, effectiveness, and user satisfaction to perform tasks performed using the application. Usability assessment is a vital part of the system development process, and a set of questions to evaluate the ITS has been developed by people interested in learning about the effectiveness of the intelligent tutoring system for teaching Android application development.

An evaluation of the proposed ITS was conducted by the lecturers and students who joined the Android Application Development Course during the second semester of 2018/2019 in the Mobile Applications Development Department of the University College of Applied Sciences (UCAS) in Gaza.

A questionnaire consisting of the items in Table 1 was filled out by each evaluator (lecturers and students). A group of 4 lecturers and 20 students divided into two groups participated in the system evaluation, one group containing 10 males and the

In assessing the proposed ITS, evaluators were required to use the proposed ITS. They were then asked to provide feedback on the proposed ITS by filling out the questionnaire consisting of the 13 questions listed above in table 1 and table 2.

In this way, the efficiency and satisfaction of the proposed ITS were measured as described in the above figure 21 and figure 22. The Overall evaluation of lecturers and students was very positive and can be seen from the figure 32.

# 5 Evaluator Comments in the questioner about the proposed system
There are some observations and recommendations for the development of the smart educational system presented by the lecturers and students where the recommendations were as follows:
- Addition of training material to teach the development of android applications by the Kotlin language.

- Adding a voice tone if the student's answer to the question is correct and add another voice tone if the student's answer to the question is wrong.

- Some questions have only one answer and the current design of the intelligent tutoring system allows the student to choose more than one answer.

- The possibility of providing a training material in Arabic to learn the development of Android applications.

- The possibility of providing a copy of the intelligent tutoring system presented to the web.

- The possibility of providing a means of direct communication with the teacher through the intelligent tutoring system in the case of some questions.

- The possibility of providing mobile application for the intelligent tutoring system offered to students.

The development recommendations and observations will be taken into account in the future work of developing the proposed Intelligent Tutoring System.

# 6. Conclusion
In this study, theory and architecture of the Intelligent Tutoring System were described in details. The ITS was designed and developed to teach Android application development by encouraging lecturers and students to use this system to increase their ability and knowledge about Android applications development. The ITS addressed some of the problems’ students and lecturers face in learning about Android application development. In addition, it provides an integrated training material to learn the development of Android applications prepared by the researchers.

The proposed ITS was presented to two groups: lecturers and students (male and female) enrolled in the Android Application Development Course during the second semester of 2018/2019 in the Mobile Application Development department of the University College of Applied Sciences (UCAS) in Gaza to test the system and provide feedback by filling out a questionnaire. The results of the evaluation were promising.

It is necessary to follow up existing results in the development of artificial intelligence and Android applications development at the same time in order to produce a reasonable method for efficient and effective purposes. In addition, It recommends using intelligent tutoring system in teaching many modern programming languages.

# 7. Future Work
For future work, I am planning to convert the ITS into a mobile application, provide a web application as well and add direct communication through chat between the student and the teacher when there are some questions. In addition to solving the problems written by participants in the evaluation process, including adding a voice tone to the success or failure of the answer and solve the problem of questions that have only one answer not to allow the student to choose more than one answer.
