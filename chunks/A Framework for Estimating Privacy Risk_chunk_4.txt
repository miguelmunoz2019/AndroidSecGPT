Indeed, breaches of personal sensitive information can lead to gigantic damage to uses. To understand why such significant data leakage has occurred, Zuo et al.  designed tools for obfuscation-resilient cloud API identification and string value analysis, and implemented them in a tool called LeakScope to identify the potential data leakage vulnerabilities from mobile apps based on how the cloud APIs are used. On the other hand, Agarwal et al.  proposed ProtectMyPrivacy (PMP), a crowd sourced recommendation engine, to analyze manual protection decisions, and use them to provide iOS App privacy recommendations. It detects access to private information and protects users by substituting anonymized data based on user decisions. However, all the above recommendation approaches do not take consideration of the potential identity assets collected by mobile Apps, which motivates our novel work with awareness of permissions and privacy policies, which actually covers first and second categories.

# 5 Conclusion
In this paper, we sought to understand the privacy risk of the set of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), or identity assets, collected, used and shared by
# A Framework for Estimating Privacy Risk Scores of Mobile Apps
mobile applications. Each mobile App has a set of data access permissions and a privacy policy. Therefore, we sought to estimate the privacy risk score of each mobile App by investigating the set of identity assets that each mobile App collects, according to its privacy policy and data access permissions.

Our approaches leveraged the identity assets collected from these mobile apps and cross-referenced these PII to a list of over 600 identity assets collected in the Identity Theft Assessment and Prediction (ITAP) project at The University of Texas at Austin. The ITAP project investigates theft and fraud user stories to assess how identity asset is monetized and the risk (likelihood) of respective identity assets to be stolen and/or fraudulently used. From these mobile apps, our results indicate that 67% of the over 600 reference identity assets were being collected by our sample dataset of 100 Android apps.

In this work, we proposed two approaches to estimate the privacy risk score of each mobile App. First approach is called Basic Measurement. It utilized the intrinsic characteristics of each identity asset to calculate the privacy risk score of each identity asset. The second approach is called Dynamic Measurement. It utilized two parameters that resulted from UT CID probabilistic models and Bayesian inference tool to refine the original risk of exposure and value of monetary loss. Our comparison with other researchersâ€™ work showed that our approaches are promising.

This work was the first to study privacy policies and permissions of mobile apps in terms of the identity assets collected, used and shared. We further studied those identity assets in the context of a personal data reference model built by the UT CID Identity Ecosystem and ITAP projects. This research provided a program to generate privacy risk score of each open-source mobile App and gave an empirical study of 100 open-source mobile Apps in different categories..
