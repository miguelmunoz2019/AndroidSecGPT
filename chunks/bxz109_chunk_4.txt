So, it is obvious that the detection rate is higher with the existence of a very large number of malicious applications placed at the top of the sorted list. So, if we get for example very low warning rate (1% or 5%), it means that our measurement is very strong concerning the calculation of the risk score. Indeed, our detection rate is very high because a large number of malwares exist in the smallest applications set with the highest risk rate. In other words, there is a high probability that the malicious applications have the highest risk score, but they may be normal in some cases. Previous studies  have used the same experimental framework.

This evaluation is used to make a comparison between malicious applications and normal applications in order to test the execution speed of the risk calculation measures and the high-risk value assignment to these applications.

# Security Risk Value Estimate Method
The main problem we encountered at the experiment time was to assign higher risk values to the malicious applications with the aim to calculate the detection rate. In our first evaluation, we measured the detection rates based on a warning rate interval between 0 and 1. Figure 5 represents Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves obtained for all the measures results including ours. Warning rate is presented by the horizontal axis, and the vertical axis shows the detection rate. As shown in the figure, our results are clearly superior to other approaches, especially that the warning rates we obtained are the lowest. Generally, all measurements converge to the full detection rate as the warning rate increases and performance remoteness decreases. However, when the false-positive number is lower, it is more desirable for the user that the warning rate is lower.

Thus, our RVC curve is very close to the one that represents the effectiveness of all the proposed risk score measures. This proves that the RVC assigns higher risk values to malicious applications compared to nonmalicious applications since RVC exploits full information gotten from previous normal and malicious instances. Also, RVC has higher generalization properties because it also uses the average behavior of these applications, which drives all unknown malicious applications to higher levels of detection rate. To better illustrate this experiment, for all the studied methods, the X axis of Figure 6 illustrates the curves obtained for the different warning rate.

We measure the area under our curve with examples of common warning rate values, such as warning rates of (1%, 10% and 20%) or otherwise noted as 0, 0 and 0 since the majority of Android users should be interested in calculating risk rates. Indeed, we calculated in the first zone the curves for the interval between 0 and 0. Figure 6 illustrates all the ROC curves and the results obtained; this figure proves that the detection rate of our measurement is the best for all warning rate values, which means that our proposition in comparison with others gives in the all cases better results.

Our proposition exploits examples of previous malicious applications, while other risk scores are based primarily on the use patterns of permissions requested by malicious applications.

applications. Also, detailed statistics of permissions and functions in malware and normal applications should be considered systematically in order to assign lower risk scores for normal applications and higher risk values for malicious applications. On the other hand, our RVC is characterized by a complete and comprehensive representation of malicious applications and normal applications that allow it to more accurately and efficiently estimate the risk rates of unknown applications. However, to improve the proposed RVC performance, we used a test evaluation between the detection rates obtained by our method and the others. In fact, for the 95% confidence interval, the test result obtained shows the existence of a real offset negligible in the detection rates averages compared to the real values.

during installation or take into consideration only the statistics impact on malicious applications. For example, the closest to our proposed RVC curve is SRS proposed by Enck et al. , its detection rate based only on the permissions scarcity in normal applications. These applications were augmented by using scale factors to improve the impact of certain critical permissions that were manually selected. On the other hand, the information extracted from all normal and malware applications is routinely processed by our proposed RVC to obtain a more realistic risk estimate.

In the second experiment, we evaluated the RVC performance obtained for the Arp et al. set and compared it with the SRS risk score for the same set. We based on the assessments made by Arp et al.  to perform this test and to select permissions and API calls that directly influence the identification and detection of all of malicious Android applications families. We choose SRS for comparison because its performance is the closest to our proposed method. In this comparison, we used the same setting from the first experiment.

So, it is possible that a permission or function is rarely used or reflects similar scarcity values in normal or malicious
# 6. CONCLUSION
In this article, we propose a new method for classifying and filtering Android apps based on their risk rate we called RVC. To evaluate our proposition effectiveness and performance, we performed a set of assessments on the actual Android applications. The results obtained show that our method is capable of getting relatively high-risk rates for unknown malicious applications as compared to normal or ordinary applications. Indeed, our RVC has a higher detection rate if we compare it with other risk methods. Likewise, our method proposed in this article distinguishes itself with its simplicity, because it is enough to calculate the remoteness between the previous applications (normal and malicious) and an unknown application to estimate its risk rate. In this article, we have classified in the same category all the malicious applications analysed. Moreover, we used a database that contains the malicious applications that have become famous for being the most important and ranked dangerous applications, which allowed us to obtain more precise risk values.
