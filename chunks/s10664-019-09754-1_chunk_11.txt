# Fabio Palomba
is a Senior Research Associate at the University of Zurich, Switzerland. He received the European PhD degree in Management & Information Technology in 2017. His PhD Thesis was the recipient of the 2017 IEEE Computer Society Best PhD Thesis Award. His research interests include software maintenance and evolution, empirical software engineering, source code quality, and mining software repositories. He was the recipient of two ACM/SIGSOFT and one IEEE/TCSE Distinguished Paper Awards at ASE’13, ICSE’15, and ICSME’17, respectively, and Best Paper Awards at CSCW’18 and SANER’18. He serves and has served as a program committee member of various international conferences (e.g., MSR, ICPC, ICSME), and as referee for various international journals (e.g., TSE, EMSE, JSS) in the field of software engineering. He has been a member of the organising committee of ICPC 2015 and SANER 2018, and program committee co-chair of MaLTeSQuE 2018 and 2019. Since 2016 he is Review Board Member of EMSE and, since 2019, Editorial Board Member of TOSEM, JSS, and SCP. He was the recipient of several Distinguished/Outstanding Reviewer Awards for his reviewing activities conducted for EMSE, IST, and JSS between 2015 and 2019.

# Dario Di Nucci
is a research fellow at the Software Languages Lab of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium. He received the Ph.D. in Management and Information Technology from the University of Salerno in 2018 advised by Prof. Andrea De Lucia with a thesis entitled “Methods and Tools for Focusing and Prioritizing the Testing Effort”. His research is on empirical software engineering, in particular software maintenance and evolution and software testing. To this aim, he applies several techniques such as machine learning, search based algorithms, and static analysis of source code. He serves and has served as a program committee member of various international conferences (e.g., ESEC/FSE, ICSME), and as referee for various international journals in the field of software engineering (e.g., TSE, EMSE, JSS) and artificial intelligence (e.g., TKDE, Neurocomputing).

# Andrea De Lucia
received the Laurea degree in computer science from the University of Salerno, Italy, in 1991, the M.Sc. degree in computer science from the University of Durham, U.K., in 1996, and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering and computer science from the University of Naples Federico II, Italy, in 1996. He is a Full Professor of software engineering at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Salerno, the coordinator of the PhD program in Computer Science, the Head of the Software Engineering Lab, and the Director of the International Summer School on Software Engineering. Previously he was at the Department of Engineering and the Research Centre on Software Technology of the University of Sannio, Italy. His research interests include software maintenance and testing, reverse engineering and re-engineering, source code analysis, code smell detection and refactoring, mining software repositories, defect prediction, empirical software engineering, search-based software engineering, traceability management, collaborative development, workflow and document management, and visual languages. He has published more than 250 papers on these topics in international journals, books, and conference proceedings and has edited books and journal special issues. Prof. De Lucia serves on the editorial boards of international journals and on the organizing and program committees of several international conferences. He is a senior member of the IEEE and was member-at-large of the executive committee of the IEEE Technical Council on Software Engineering.
