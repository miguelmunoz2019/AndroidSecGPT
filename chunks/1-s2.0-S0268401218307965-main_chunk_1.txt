Recent privacy-related incidents of mobile services have shown that app stores and providers face the challenge of mobile users’ information privacy concerns, which can prevent users from installing mobile apps or induce them to uninstall an app. In this paper, we investigate the role of app permission requests and compare the impact on privacy concerns with other antecedents of information privacy concerns, i.e., prior privacy experience, computer anxiety, and perceived control. To test these effects empirically, we conducted an online survey with 775 participants. Results of our structural equation modeling show that prior privacy experience, computer anxiety, and perceived control have significant effects on privacy concerns. However, concerns for app permission requests have approximately twice as much predictive value than the other factors put together to explain mobile users’ overall information privacy concerns. We expect that our findings can provide a theoretical contribution for future mobile privacy research as well as practical implications for app stores and providers.

# 1. Introduction
Once again, information privacy concerns have been in the main focus of the most recent Facebook privacy scandal, where 14 million users have unknowingly posted private information to the public due to a software bug . Earlier this year, Facebook was under investigation due to the use of its data by political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, which collected personal information of approximately 87 million Facebook users without their explicit consent to access their data . Social networking services other than Facebook have also been at the heart of information privacy concerns. For example, a few years ago, the social networking app Path had collected personal information from mobile users’ address books without their knowledge and consent . Such privacy-related incidents that mobile users may experience are one of a few reasons for them to abandon the use of mobile apps. In a survey of 714 mobile app users, the Pew Research Center found that 54 percent of the respondents had decided not to install and 30 percent had decided to uninstall mobile apps due to privacy concerns about their personal information (Boyles, Smith, & Madden, 2012). Although the access to personal information can be advantageous for mobile users, for example, the access to location is used for navigation purposes by some apps, it also evokes privacy concerns with the result that users delete apps from their devices (eMarketer, 2016). For app providers, it is therefore important to understand and alleviate mobile users’ concerns for their information privacy.

privacy concerns. To that end, we expect that our results will provide implications, which will be relevant to app stores and providers regarding decision-making of implementing app permissions, such that privacy concerns can be further mitigated. As an initial step, our survey-based data analysis reveals a problem with existing designs of permission requests, which refers to app permission concerns and offers implications for practice and directions for future research. Based on the findings of our study, we anticipate that the design of app permission requests will require a change due to mobile users’ growing privacy concerns, which we discuss more in-depth in Sections 6 and 7.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of app permission requests regarding mobile users’ concerns for information privacy. To address this gap, we draw on the construct of mobile users’ information privacy concerns (MUIPC) (Xu, Gupta, Rosson, & Carroll, 2012) to measure users’ privacy concerns in a mobile context, and we situate our research within the framework of the overarching macro model labeled “Antecedents–Privacy Concerns–Outcomes” (APCO) (Dinev, McConnell, & Smith, 2015; Smith, Dinev, & Xu, 2011), of which we focus on the antecedents of prior privacy experience (Smith, Milberg, & Burke, 1996), computer anxiety (Stewart & Segars, 2002), and perceived control . In our mobile user context, we add app permission concerns as an antecedent of MUIPC and propose the following research question: What impact do app permission concerns have on mobile users’ overall information privacy concerns compared to the privacy-related antecedents prior privacy experience, computer anxiety, and perceived control? The paper is structured as follows: First, a theoretical foundation of the MUIPC construct and antecedents of information privacy concerns is presented, followed by our research model and hypothesis generation. Then, we describe the research design and show results from our survey-based data analysis. Following the discussion of our findings, we provide a contribution to theory and implications for practice. Finally, we conclude with limitations and future research directions.

# 2. Theoretical foundation
# 2. Mobile users’ information privacy concerns
The MUIPC construct was first introduced by Xu, Gupta et al. (2012), which is based on the scale of concern for information privacy (CFIP)  and Internet users’ information privacy concerns (IUIPC) (Malhotra, Kim, & Agarwal, 2004). The CFIP scale measures “individuals’ concerns about organizational information privacy practices” with four subscales: collection, errors, improper access, and unauthorized secondary use (Smith et al., 1996, p. 169). Collection describes individuals’ perception that “great quantities of data regarding their personalities, background, and actions are being accumulated” (Smith et al., 1996, p. 171). The collection of personal information enables companies to use this information about individuals in relationship marketing and to target offers more accurately to individuals’ interests (Culnan & Armstrong, 1999). Due to errors and improper access, individuals become concerned that companies should take more measures to reduce errors and control access to personal information . With regard to companies’ potential opportunistic behaviors (Laufer & Wolfe, 1977), unauthorized secondary use refers to the selling or sharing of a person’s information without their authorization . Referring to Malhotra et al. (2004), IUIPC serves as a “tool for analyzing online consumers’ privacy concerns and reactions to various privacy threats on the Internet” (p. 348), which draws on the social contract and justice theories, identifying three dimensions of privacy concerns: collection of personal information (distributive justice), control over personal information (procedural justice), and awareness of organizational information privacy practices (interactional and informational justice).
