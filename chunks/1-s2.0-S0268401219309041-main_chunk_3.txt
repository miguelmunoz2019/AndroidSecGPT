IS researchers have adopted the CPM theory to investigate privacy-related phenomena in online settings. Anderson and Agarwal (2011) applied CPM to predict the factors that affect patients’ willingness to provide access to personal health information. Xu et al. (2011) identified boundary management using CPM to predict the privacy concerns of users in web information transactions. Similarly, CPM has been applied to explain user intentions to disclose personal information to social networking sites (Choi & Land, 2016; Liu & Wang, 2018; Osatuyi, Passerini, Ravarini, & Grandhi, 2018; Walton & Rice, 2013). There are studies that partly adopted this theory to explain user behaviors, such as identifying perceived risk as forming the boundary to predict online community users’ intentions to share information (Posey, Lowry, Roberts, & Ellis, 2010). In the mobile context, contemporary studies show that CPM theory is a useful lens for explaining the mobile commerce activities of app users based on their boundary management (Eastin, Brinson, Doorey, & Wilcox, 2016). Among the overarching theories in the areas of security and privacy, this study draws on CPM to explain the interaction of privacy-related concerns and security. As users are sharing their personal information with mobile app providers, the providers become the co-owner of users’ private information. Consequently, CPM is helpful in explaining how individuals form their privacy boundaries and how they perceive the regulation of these boundaries by institutions (Liu & Wang, 2018; Xu et al., 2011).

# 3. Hypotheses
# 3. Boundary formation
Per CPM theory, the first step in understanding how individuals regard their privacy is to investigate how they establish their privacy boundaries (Petronio, 2002, 2008). As part of risk assessment, which happens in the early stages of boundary formation, individuals develop a perception of privacy risks associated with disclosing some private information to gain access to some promised benefits (Shaw & Sergueeva, 2019; Xu et al., 2011). For this reason, this study includes perceived privacy risk as a sub-set of boundary formation, which is proposed as being an important factor in the cost-benefit assessment of privacy boundary formation. In this context, perceived privacy risk is defined as the expected loss potential associated with releasing personal information to mobile apps.

Examples of the personal information that apps request are: (a) location; (b) contact lists and calendars; (c) photos and videos; (d) microphone; and (e) credit card information . Allowing an app to access such personal information can jeopardize user privacy (King & Jessen, 2010) through the misuse of personal information, selling users’ information to marketing and financial institutions without the users’ permission,1 insider disclosure, unauthorized access, and information theft (Dinev & Hart, 2006). In fact, mobile apps often make it mandatory for the user to share some private information to benefit from the basic functionalities of apps . On the other hand, users know that there is a chance of privacy invasion even with safeguards in place (Hong & Thong, 2013). Therefore, users must assess how the possible privacy risks would affect them when managing their privacy boundaries.

Prior studies have found that perceived privacy and security are distinct, but can affect each other (Bansal & Zahedi, 2014; Bansal, 2017; Chellappa, 2008). For example, Chellappa (2008) showed that the perceived privacy of e-commerce transactions positively influences the perceived security of these transactions. It has also been found that privacy risks affect the privacy perceptions of users (Dinev & Hart, 2006; Dinev et al., 2006; Dinev, Xu, Smith, & Hart, 2013; Liu & Wang, 2018; Xu et al., 2011). Given that the literature explicitly states a causal chain relationship between the discussed concepts, we posit that privacy risks and security are connected. Contemporary literature has shown there is a relationship between the perception of privacy risks and perceived security. For example, Johnson et al. (2018) showed that the perceived privacy risks of using mobile payment apps negatively impacts users’ perceptions of the security of such apps. This study expands this argument and posits that users of any type of mobile app associate the risk of losing data through the mobile app with the security of the app. In other words, users perceive the security of mobile apps to be weak when they perceive a high probability of losing data. Thus, we hypothesize:

The perceived privacy risk of using mobile apps negatively influences the perceived security of mobile apps.

# Boundary coordination and turbulence
Boundary coordination and turbulence is the other aspect of CPM theory (Petronio, 2002, 2008). This aspect addresses how the shared information will be coordinated and handled if any issues arise (e.g., data breaches). When users share private information with mobile apps, the mobile apps become the co-owner of the data. Therefore, by clearly describing how user information will be managed (i.e., in privacy policy statements), the app providers coordinate boundary rules with the users (as the co-owners of data) and state how to cope with boundary turbulence situations, such as unauthorized information disclosure. In fact, privacy policies often consist of the app providers’ assurance practices to protect users’ personal information, and the practices recommended by industry regulations and government laws . As a result, privacy policies can inform users about the use and process of their information (boundary coordination) and are the means of recourse in case of unauthorized disclosure (boundary turbulence). The privacy policy of Amazon’s mobile app states that users’ personal information will be used for or shared with: (a) affiliated businesses that they (Amazon) do not control; (b) third-party service providers; (c) promotional offers; and (d) business transfers. Amazon also discusses how the information will be gathered (e.g., automatic, mobile, email) and what their security measures are (e.g., revealing only the last four digits of credit cards on accounts and using SSL software to add layers of encryption; Amazon, 2017).

To capture users’ perceptions of boundary coordination and turbulence, contemporary research has used the effectiveness of privacy policies, which refers to the extent to which a user believes that the privacy notice shown on the mobile app provides accurate and reliable information about the mobile app’s information privacy practices (Liu & Wang, 2018; Xu et al., 2011). Although there are arguments that users do not read privacy policies, research has shown that privacy policies matter to users for privacy decision making (Tsai, Egelman, Cranor, & Acquisti, 2011). In general, in the US, which hosts many of the leading tech companies, privacy policies are built around the US Federal Trade Commission’s Act. This includes five principles of fair information practice – notice, choice, access, security, and enforcement (Bansal et al., 2015; Wu, Huang, Yen, & Popova, 2012). Therefore, privacy policies include information about collecting and controlling user information, as well as information about security practices in place to protect users’ data, which addresses user concerns and

promotes a positive attitude toward the effectiveness of the privacy policies. Prior research has found that when users perceive privacy policies to have a high effectiveness, they perceive mobile apps to be secure (Nikkhah and Sabherwal, 2017a, 2017b; Nikkhah, Balapour et al., 2018, Nikkhah, Grover, & Sabherwal, 2018). Similarly, we argue that when users believe that information on protective practices in a mobile app’s privacy policies is reliable and accurate, they have a higher perception of the security of the app. Thus, we propose that:
# H2.

The perceived effectiveness of the privacy policy of mobile apps positively influences the perceived security of mobile apps.

As discussed earlier, privacy policies mitigate users’ privacy concerns because they incorporate “assurance cues” that reduce the risk of losing information through the use of mobile apps . They address users’ concerns about the risk of online information transaction, by stating (a) what personal information is collected from users, (b) the accuracy and completeness of the data collection process, and (c) whether and how the collected information may be used for other purposes . Given recent studies show that privacy policies influence user perceptions of privacy risk in different online settings (Chang, Wong, Libaque-Saenz, & Lee, 2018; Gerlach, Widjaja, & Buxmann, 2015; Xu et al., 2011), we argue that when users feel assurance practices in the privacy statements of mobile apps are fair and effective, they perceive a lower risk of working with mobile apps. Thus, we posit that:
# H3.

The perceived effectiveness of a privacy policy is negatively associated with the perceived privacy risk of mobile apps.
