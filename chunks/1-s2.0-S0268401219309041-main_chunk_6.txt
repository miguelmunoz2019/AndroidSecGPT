# 6. Discussion
Mobile apps have become ubiquitous in everyday life, which has led mobile app developers to persistently provide new apps to meet users’ evolving needs. However, user security concerns are a barrier to the diffusion of mobile computing technologies, including mobile apps (Lin, Huang, Wright, & Kambourakis, 2014). This study used CPM theory (Petronio, 2002, 2008) to predict how privacy concerns regarding mobile apps affect users’ security perceptions. By extension, a research model was proposed in which perceived privacy risks represented the boundary rule formation of CPM and the perceived effectiveness of privacy policies represented boundary coordination and turbulence. The findings suggest that perceived privacy risk negatively affects the security perception of mobile apps, which is consistent with existing literature . When users perceive that the risk of using the mobile app is higher than its benefits, they tend to perceive the app to be less secure. For instance, if exchanging personal information over a mobile communication app comes with high risks, then the user assumes this app is not as secure as it should be.

In addition, this study finds that privacy policies play a key role in predicting the perceived security of mobile apps. Prior studies found the effectiveness of a privacy policy decreases the perception of privacy risk for online banking customers  and general online web users , but such effect has not been examined in the context of mobile apps. In particular, the results suggest that when users perceive a privacy policy to be effective, they perceive fewer privacy risks inherent in the app and perceive a high level of security. There is little research that has studied the role privacy policies play in security perceptions, but the empirical findings of this study resonate with the fact that the privacy policies of mobile apps actively communicate the security strategies, precursors, and measures used to protect users’ private data (i.e., Bank of America, 2018; Dropbox, 2018). So, when users perceive such policies to be effective, their security perception of the mobile app increases.

The results also show that users’ perceived privacy awareness moderates the effect of perceived privacy risk on the perceived security of mobile apps. As shown in Fig. 3, under high privacy awareness conditions for both samples, the relationship between perceived privacy risk and the perceived security of mobile apps becomes stronger (the slope is steeper). When individuals increase their knowledge about privacy practices and issues, by reading and watching news, books, and privacy statements, they tend to be on high alert. It is difficult for these users to deem apps as secure, given the negative information in the media about the security of mobile technologies. Being aware of privacy and security practices is not a substitute for users knowing their information can still be compromised, even if the most rigorous privacy and security measures are in place (Hong & Thong, 2013).

The findings suggest that the user differences between more sensitive and less sensitive apps only exists for the relationship between the perceived effectiveness of privacy policies and the perceived privacy risk. When individuals use applications requiring sensitive information, such as mobile banking apps, the perceived effectiveness of the privacy policy has a greater effect on their perception of the privacy risk compared to the use of an app that requires less sensitive information, such as note-taking apps. Similarly, we observed a difference between the influence of perceived privacy risk on perceived security for both groups, which highlights that, for users providing more sensitive information, the perceived security risk is more dependent on the mitigation of privacy risks, compared to users providing less sensitive information.

However, no such difference across the groups was found for the relationship between the perceived effectiveness of privacy policies and the security of mobile apps. This suggests that, when it comes to risk mitigation, both groups see privacy policies as functioning equally in assuring that security measures are in place to protect the user. Li et al. (2011) suggest that information sensitivity affects some of the relationships (but not all) in a privacy-related study. In particular, they theorized that the sensitivity of information moderates the effect of users’ perceived information relevancy on privacy risk belief.

The results also indicate that age negatively influences perceived security for users providing more sensitive information. This means that, as an individual’s age increases, their security perception of mobile apps decreases. As age comes with experience, aged people may have experienced more security incidents, so could be less optimistic about the security of mobile apps. This could also be explained by the optimistic bias in younger people, which manifests in the form of having higher security perceptions. Surprisingly, gender has different effects on perceived security (model 1 vs. model 2). For the more sensitive group, being female was associated with having a higher perception of the security of mobile apps. However, for the less sensitive group, being female was associated with having a lower perception of the security of mobile apps. Gender was positively associated with perceived security, whereas for the less sensitive group, it was negatively associated with the perceived security of mobile apps. The cross-group comparison revealed a statistically meaningful difference between the effect of gender on the perceived security of mobile apps across both groups. Overall, the results show that users’ privacy concerns do affect their perceptions of the security of mobile apps, which can hinder their adoption and diffusion.

# 6. Implications for research and practice
The findings of this study have implications for both researchers and practitioners. The most important contribution of this paper is that privacy antecedents affect users’ perceptions of security. Although security and privacy have been studied together or separately, to our knowledge, prior studies did not consider how the antecedents of privacy affect security, even though these concepts are related (as shown in this study). In practice, mobile app developers actively address security in their privacy policy statements, which demonstrates that these concepts and their antecedents are related (e.g. Dropbox); however, scientific conversation is lacking in the mobile apps context. Therefore, one of this study’s objectives was to extend the scholarly discussion on the effects of behavioral privacy-related variables on behavioral security.

This study contributes to the ongoing debate regarding mobile threats and mobile security issues. Existing literature emphasizes that investing in technology to enhance security is not always the solution; there should also be an emphasis on teaching individuals to improve their security behaviors . Accordingly, this study investigated the factors that affect users’ behavioral security. In many cases, mobile security incidents happen due to users’ lack of knowledge or their use of insecure practices when using their mobile phone. In particular, this study shed light on the sensitive role of privacy policies in shaping users’ privacy and security perceptions, which could be studied further in future studies. For example, a future research question could be: what section(s) of a privacy policy statement are more effective for forming users’ privacy and security perceptions? Or what are the characteristics of an effective privacy policy statement in users’ minds?
This study used CPM theory (Petronio, 2002, 2008) to propose a research model that predicts the effect of privacy perceptions on users’ perceptions of mobile app security. By using the CPM theory, the results of testing the nomological model of privacy and security show that the effectiveness of privacy policies and privacy risk (two antecedents of privacy concerns) affect users’ perceptions of mobile app security. Consequently, we encourage future researchers to adopt CPM to measure and explain security-related phenomena, as we have justified this theory as a good fit for explaining behavioral security.

The results of this study have implications for practice as well. Mobile app developers who are planning to develop or improve their apps should work towards using the potential of privacy policies, which (we found)
7 This could also be examined from the male perspective: (1) for the more sensitive group, being male was associated with a lower perception of security; (2) for the less sensitive group, being male was associated with a higher perception of security.

reduces users’ perceptions of privacy risk and affects users’ security perceptions. By extension, institutions can provide guidelines within privacy policies to help users improve their security and privacy behaviors. Several examples of daily behavior that can potentially lead to privacy and security exposure, such as allowing children to download insecure gaming apps that request access to personal information, are often overlooked by parents. Privacy policies could also provide guidelines on password setting or common examples of fraudulent activities that users might not be aware of. Currently, app developers try to meet only the minimum standards of the security and privacy guidelines set by industry regulations, but they should take advantage of the privacy policy to educate users by providing examples of how security and privacy violations can happen.
