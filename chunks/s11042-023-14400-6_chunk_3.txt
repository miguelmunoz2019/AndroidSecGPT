Tchakounté et al.  developed an analysis tool called LimonDroid to identify malicious characters in Android apps. Using Yet Another Recursive/Ridiculous Acronym (YARA)  rules, this tool exposed malicious characters of Metasploit, Fake Apps, LeadBolt, Ransomware, RuMMS, Viking Horde, and XBot in scanned applications. Studies show that LimonDroid outperforms existing similarity-based solutions. It can also predict the class of an application with 97% accuracy. Dimolianis et al.  have presented an integrated scheme for signature-based traffic classification processing for DDoS protection. With this signature-based scheme, it outperformed traditional IP-based schemes in terms of malicious traffic categorization, cardinality of filtering rules, and packet processing efficiency in high-speed networks. The AMD framework, developed by Patil et al. , includes a VM operator that detects known malware with signature and anomaly detection techniques. The downside is that due to its distributed and dynamic nature, it includes security issues for cloud computing. VMs were over 96% successful in detecting malware. Thus, it secured the high-risk VMs of cloud computing. FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) performs a file system scan based on Nessus and YARA signatures developed by Jaramillo . This application is developed against Mirai botnets, which are malware that includes DDoS attacks, damaging banking systems. Nessus is not open source and is low-cost. Savenko et al.  have done a study that generates virus signatures based on API call tracing. The recommended signature format for detecting malware allows distinguishing malicious applications from other applications by key.

API calls. Up to 96% success was achieved in the trial results. Venugopal and Hu  have detailed a signature matching algorithm used in mobile device scanning. They developed their proposed signature-based malware detection method for low-memory mobile devices. This algorithm provides fast scanning and consumes less than 50% of memory compared to the Clam-AV scanner. Jeong et al.  presented a real-time malware detection software that named as SafeGuard. Shrivastava and Kumar  presented a Android Intent and permission based software that named as SensDroid.

# 4 Machine learning-based techniques
Machine learning (behavioral) based techniques are widely used in cyber security applications. Using this technique on a benign malware dataset, both unforeseen and known threats can be detected. Machine learning-based methods are preferred by many researchers in cyber security products, especially since they are more successful than signature-based methods in detecting zero-day attacks. In this section, we examine studies in which machine learning-based methods are used as a tool in malware analysis studies.

In their study of machine learning-based mobile malware detection using highly unstable network traffic, Chen et al.  confirmed that machine learning algorithms are effective in analyzing malicious mobile network traffic. Malicious mobile network traffic data is one of the well-known highly imbalanced datasets. However, they have shown that once the data imbalance reaches over 4000, no method can be effective on highly unstable problems. The proposed methods detect the malicious traffic flow in a very big benign traffic flow when the imbalance ratio is under 4000. Hatcher et al.  conducted mobile threat monitoring and detection studies using four machine learning methods (ZeroR, OneR, Naïve Bayes, and J48). As a result of the study, it was found that the best classifier could achieve 100% accuracy with a detection rate of 94%. Feizollah et al.  in their study comparing five types of machine learning classifiers (Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Trees, MLP, and SVM) for anomaly-based mobile botnet detection, reached a detection rate of 99% with KNN. Wang et al.  have proposed Machine Learning-Assisted Secure Mobile Electronic Payment Framework (ML-SMEPF) to detect malware, fraud, authentication issues in mobile transactions. They have proven the reliability of the framework in the simulation performed according to accuracy, safety, performance, and cost factor. Li et al.  highlighted the importance of mobile vehicle social networks (VSNs), which will provide a new method of code propagation with the evolution of 5G networks. They proposed the ‘‘Machine Learning based Code Dissemination by Selecting Reliability Mobile Vehicles in 5G Networks’’ (MLCD) to select lower-cost codes and code spreading tools with high reliability and coverage. In their study, they concluded that by comparing the MLCD scheme with other schemes, it can improve code propagation security by 83% and 18% with limited costs, and the coverage rate of updated information by 23% in 5G networks.

Sarker et al.  developed a machine learning-based cyber security attack detection model called IntruDTree. They tested the effectiveness of the model by conducting experiments on cyber security datasets. They analyzed the effectiveness of IntruDTree, a tree-based generalized intrusion detection model, by comparing it to traditional popular machine learning methods. They emphasized that the effectiveness of the model can be evaluated in IoT security services and cyber security in the future. Bosaeed et al.  have proposed a model on SMS Spam Detection and Classification System based on Fog Augmented Machine Learning. In this technique, in which they use three classification methods (Naïve Bayes (NB), Support
# 4 Security measures to protect from malware and threats
Software vulnerabilities in mobile devices, vulnerabilities in wireless networks, security flaws caused by user errors, and security flaws in mobile applications are factors that attract malicious attackers. Users, application developers, network designers, and application market managers have responsibilities to prevent the transmission of malware and threats to mobile devices.

Smartphones are small computers. Users should protect their phones from fake and adware containing malware. They should use a good malware framework like a firewall and download apps (games, marketing, etc.) only from trusted app markets (Apple Store and Google Play Store, etc.). In addition, features such as WiFi or Bluetooth should not be left open if they are not in use, to protect against malware that can be transmitted by proximity contact with peer-to-peer communication methods.

There is heavy user activity on networks around the world. Users may have to share their personal data with the network service. Although their privacy policies are strongly defined and analyzed, users do not know how their information is managed by network providers and they use Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. to benefit from their services. provide their information to service providers . Due to the nature of information sharing and the need to process big data, including web data sources, privacy protection becomes more difficult . Security control protocols may also be missing in this law. For all these reasons, users should be aware that their personal data may be exposed to malicious attacks while shopping online, browsing online sites, and during any transaction on the internet.

Network designers must protect network traffic from intruders such as attackers and opportunistic malware. For example, when the user connects to a free Wi-Fi, hackers may be listening to that data connection line and the user’s personal data is in danger.

Application security is the precautions to be taken to avoid exposure to malicious attacks while developing applications and to prevent theft of important data in the application. In order to develop a secure application; During the planning, design, implementation, and testing phases, security studies should be carried out completely. Finally, after the application is released, the process should be followed, new security vulnerabilities should be detected, and updates should be made.

Server-side inspection processes have been developed to successfully test installed applications and detect malware. Administrators should implement well-defined security policies. For example, iPhone applications can only be downloaded from the App Store. In other words, applications that comply with Apple’s security policies can be installed on iPhone devices.

# 5 Conclusion

Malware and threats are rapidly diversifying, renewing, and improving themselves. Mobile security is not only directly related to the operating system and used device but also related with communication over the internet, data encryption, data summarization, and users’ privacy awareness.

In this paper, we first touched on malware and attack types, and security vulnerabilities. Then, current threat detection and prevention methods were deeply analyzed. Finally, we reviewed the ongoing threat detection and prevention efforts of developers in the mobile security space that were reported in recent mobile security threat reports.

While there are new methods in security studies related to mobile devices, malicious attackers also develop new methods in malware and threats. Security efforts in personal and corporate mobile devices need to be strengthened to protect against malicious attacks that continue with unpredictable growth.
