The advent of the Android system has brought smartphone technology to the doorsteps of the masses. The latest technologies have made it affordable for every section of the society. However, the emergence of the Android platform has also escalated the growth of cybercrime through the mobile platform. Its open source operating system has made it a center of attraction for the attackers. This article provides a comprehensive study of the state of the Android Security domain. This article classifies the attacks on the Android system in four categories (i) hardware-based attacks, (ii) kernel-based attacks, (iii) hardware abstraction layer-based attacks, and (iv) application-based attacks. The study deals with various threats and security measures relating to these categories and presents an in-depth analysis of the underlying problems in the Android security domain. The article also stresses the role of Android application developers in realizing a more secure Android environment. This article attempts to provide a comparative analysis of various malware detection techniques concerning their methods and limitations. The study can help researchers gain knowledge of the Android security domain from various aspects and build a more comprehensive, robust, and efficient solution to the threats that Android is facing.

# 1 INTRODUCTION
In the past few decades, the number of smartphone users has grown exponentially and it is expected to reach 2 billion users by 2020 . Availability of high-speed Internet on mobile phones and increased social media activity are the primary causes for the accelerated growth of smartphones, especially those that are Android based. The cost competitiveness in the smartphone market has also contributed to this growth and has made smartphones available to the middle- and lower-income groups as well. This availability and the features of the latest smartphones have made the population dependent on these phones for their daily work, such as paying household bills through phone banking or transferring essential documents. The operating system is an

integral part of these smartphones and is responsible for the functioning of the device, which makes it prone to attacks that take control of the device. Hence, it becomes essential for developers of malware detection tools to have an idea of the loopholes and vulnerabilities present in various parts of the operating system.

According to the International Data Corporation (IDC) , the Android operating system covers around 85% of the world’s smartphone market. Android gained popularity around 2010. Since then it has been ruling the smartphone market. According to the mobile overview report by Scientiamobile , Android 6 (Marshmallow) is the most popular version of the smartphone operating system.

Because of its increasing popularity, Android is drawing the attention of malware developers and cyber-attackers. Each year the number of Android malware families is increasing at a higher rate. These attacks vary regarding their functioning, the part of the system targeted, and the vulnerabilities exploited. This article aims to provide comprehensive knowledge of the attacks in respect to these factors. The researchers can use this study to develop sophisticated malware detection tools, for Android, which can thwart the malware developers from harming the system using any of these vulnerabilities. Many kinds of malware are discussed in this article. Most of the times, the malware developers emphasize on developing malware that they can use to extract profit. For example, Ransomware  is one such malware family that once installed in the user’s system, gives the control of the system to the attacker. The attacker then demands a huge ransom from the victim for releasing the data that otherwise attacker threatens to leak to the outside world. Ransomware is no longer limited to just windows or PC; it is evolving as a threat for smartphones as well as IoT devices. Other than Ransomware, Android malware families that are popular are spyware, bots, Adware, Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUA), Trojans, and Trojan spyware. PUA is the topmost Android malware detected by Quick Heal . The attackers use third-party application stores and repacked applications to propagate these malicious programs. They extract the private information of the user, without his/her consent, and then send it to the server; later, they use this information for black marketing and social engineering purposes.

Of all the malware, Trojans hold a significant share in spreading malicious content. The latest malware detection statistics have shown an increase in the number of mobile Ransomware and banking Trojans. In 2016, Kaspersky Lab detected 128,886 lakh mobile banking Trojans and around 261,214 mobile Ransomware Trojans . Malware developers are continually working in the direction of finding new methods to unearth loopholes in the Android system. Although the latest Android systems now feature robust security mechanisms, malware developers are finding new techniques to evade the security policies of the system. Gugi is an example of a banking Trojan that can exploit the security policies of Android Marshmallow. The Google Play store has dozens of Android apps that are malicious and have already infected millions of Android phones. For example, researchers found that Judy, which affected around 36 million Android users , was present in around 40 applications in the Google Play Store. South Korean Company Kininwini developed these malicious applications. The majority of malicious applications are designed to gain root access to the system, and the malware developers craft them so well that it is tough to detect them, and they keep on working in silence; users have no idea that the malware has endangered their system. After gaining control of these systems, these malicious applications can perform dangerous actions and can also infect other devices connected to the infected system. Android malware has become a marketplace for hackers and malware developers. They are earning a considerable amount of money from this source. The Dark Web is one such example; it is a marketplace for criminals to buy and sell mobile malware, and the malware developers sell it as a component of software packages. On the Dark Web, malware and some other tools that are capable of evading many operating systems like Android and iOS are available at a lower price, thereby gaining the

interest of hackers and causing an increase in criminal activities . Malware has become a severe threat to modern society, which is increasingly becoming dependent on smart technologies for day-to-day activities.

This article provides a comprehensive analysis of various threats, challenges, and solutions relating to security in the Android environment as specified below.

Section 2 discusses a wide range of attacks targeting three essential components of the Android device, which include the hardware, kernel, and applications. The article emphasizes vulnerabilities in the system, attack strategy, and possible solutions to the attacks. This section also provides a brief description of the security measures adopted in the latest Android version Oreo and the conceptualization of possible attack on it. The following Section 3 discusses in detail the security loopholes in the Android environment that are exploited by malware developers such as the permission system, security protocols, and poor developer practices. After a detailed perusal of articles and current attack trends, one can observe how attacks remain prevalent due to technical glitches and loopholes found in the areas mentioned above. One key takeaway from the study is the fact that lack of awareness about the use of security protocols and poor developer practices are the primary cause of security threats to Android. Further, Section 4 provides the analysis of defensive mechanisms such as antivirus and static, dynamic, and hybrid approaches to the malware discussion. Last, Section 5 talks about the present scenario of the Android system regarding security and future research directions.
