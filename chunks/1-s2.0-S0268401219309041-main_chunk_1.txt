Despite mobile applications being at the frontier of mobile computation technologies, security issues pose a threat to their adoption and diffusion. Recent studies suggest that security violations could be mitigated through improved security behaviors and attitudes, not just through better technologies. Existing literature on behavioral security suggests that one of the main predictors of users’ perceptions of security is their perceived privacy concerns. Using communication privacy management theory (CPM), this study examines the effects of privacy-related perceptions, such as privacy risk and the effectiveness of privacy policies, on the security perceptions of mobile app users. To empirically test the proposed theoretical model, two survey studies were conducted using mobile apps requesting less sensitive information (n = 487) and more sensitive information (n = 559). The findings show that the perceived privacy risk negatively influences the perceived security of the mobile apps; the perceived effectiveness of a privacy policy positively influences user perceptions of mobile app security; and perceived privacy awareness moderates the effect of perceived privacy risk on the perceived security of mobile apps. The results also suggest that users have different privacy-security perceptions based on the information sensitivity of the mobile apps. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

# 1. Introduction
Mobile apps have become an inherent part of everyday life. They have dominated individuals’ digital habits due to the progress of mobile technologies, mobile access to high-speed internet, and the interactivity of mobile phone interfaces. From communicating to entertaining, mobile apps provide a variety of useful features that cause individuals to spend a great amount of time on their use . A recent study demonstrated that individuals in the US spend an average of three and a half hours per day on mobile devices, with mobile apps comprising 90 % of internet time on smartphones and 77 % on tablets . As a result, a plethora of mobile apps are released into app marketplaces every day, to respond to demands for online shopping, games, finance management, and other tasks that users can complete with their mobile devices (Balapour, Reychav, Sabherwal, & Azuri, 2019; Balapour and Sabherwal, 2017). One report suggests that an average of 6140 mobile apps were released through the Google Play Store every day from the third quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of 2018 . However, despite these high numbers, most individuals in the US are hesitant to download mobile apps, with the number of downloads at an average of zero per month . Further research has shown that 80 % of users do not use the mobile apps they have downloaded after three months . Among the reasons why individuals do not install or continue to use mobile apps, users’ concerns about security and privacy risks are found to be the most salient (Harris, Brookshire, & Chin, 2016; Levenson, 2016; Shah, Peikari, & Yasin, 2014) and merit further investigation.

The growth in the release and use of mobile apps is accompanied by the growth of mobile users’ concerns about using them . Users are worried about the vulnerability of mobile apps, in terms of security, and that apps may possess malicious codes that track their activity, steal sensitive data, and make unauthorized calls . Prior literature emphasizes that technical security methods alone are not enough to protect users, and there is a need to account for individual behavior in security studies (Posey, Roberts, Lowry, Bennett, & Courtney, 2013; Posey, Roberts, Lowry, & Hightower, 2014). Security concerns have been found to have a great impact on user intentions to install and continue using mobile apps . For example, Starbucks acknowledged in 2015 that hackers accessed customer accounts through the Starbucks mobile app, resulting in many mobile users removing this app from their devices due to security concerns . Users also have privacy concerns about using mobile apps and these concerns impact their perceptions (Shaw & Sergueeva, 2019). A report on mobile apps showed

that 52 % of users delete mobile apps and 40 % stop using apps because of privacy concerns . Mobile app developers need to better understand security and privacy perceptions, to decrease mobile users’ concerns by devising appropriate security and privacy solutions, thereby attracting new users and retaining current ones. As security and privacy are the main concerns of mobile users for continuing to use apps, studying security and privacy perceptions and the relationship between them can help mobile app developers provide composite security and privacy features, instead of separate features, resulting in lower cost, time, and effort to provide secure mobile apps.

Against this backdrop, information system (IS) researchers have investigated security and privacy perceptions in different mobile technology contexts. For example, Johnson, Kiser, Washington, and Torres (2018) examined the predictors of mobile payment usage intentions and found that perceived security has a positive impact on user intentions towards mobile payment services. Keith, Babb, Furner, Abdullat, and Lowry (2016) conducted a cost-benefit analysis to examine drivers and inhibitors of mobile app adoption, finding that privacy risks inhibit users from adopting and disclosing information to mobile apps. Prior research has also noted that, although security and privacy are distinct, they are interrelated and affect each other (Smith, Dinev, & Xu, 2011). Bansal (2017) argued that security is concerned with protection and privacy is concerned with governance and use, but more work is needed to understand the relationship between these concepts. However, the relationship between security and privacy in the mobile app context has received little attention and is limited to examining the effects of one privacy-related construct on security perceptions in the adoption model (e.g., Johnson et al., 2018) or the information disclosure model (Nikkhah and Sabherwal, 2017a; Nikkhah, Balapour, and Sabherwal, 2018). Thus, we extend this idea and crystalize the relationship between security and the privacy perceptions of mobile apps in a single nomological network. This helps mobile security and privacy researchers to clearly relate the security and privacy perceptions of mobile apps and examine them appropriately in their studies.

This study builds upon the CPM theory  to address the research question: do privacy perceptions impact users’ perceptions of mobile apps’ security? This research contributes to security and privacy literature, as we investigate the effects of privacy perceptions on security perceptions in the context of the information sensitivity of mobile apps. As prior research found that users have different privacy perceptions when working with less or more sensitive information (Li, Sarathy, & Xu, 2011; Malhotra, Kim, & Agarwal, 2004), this study explicitly includes the moderating effect of information sensitivity in the research model. This aims to determine whether the relationship between privacy and security perceptions differs for mobile apps that use less sensitive information (e.g., notetaking apps) and those that use more sensitive information (e.g., mobile-banking apps). Therefore, two separate studies were conducted to investigate the moderating effects of information sensitivity on the effects of privacy on security. Further, mobile app developers provide privacy policies to inform users of their fair information practices and provide assurances that the app will protect users’ data and will not behave opportunistically. Users are able to see privacy policy statements on app marketplaces (e.g., App Store, Google Play) before downloading the app, or are prompted by app developers after installation to view and accept any new privacy policy updates. However, there is a need for more investigation on the effectiveness of privacy policy presence on mobile apps in the two contexts of less sensitive and more sensitive apps that are part of this study’s objectives.

This study begins by reviewing existing security and privacy studies and identifying the main findings in these areas. Then, a research model based on CPM theory is proposed and is tested with two surveys – one for apps accessing less sensitive information (n = 487) and the other for apps accessing more sensitive information (n = 559). Subsequently, the results of hypotheses testing with covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) are presented and the paper concludes with a discussion of research and practice implications.
