# Document Similarity Comparison (DSC)
As we mention in Section 2, some APPGs allow users to customize the content to some extent, and APPG users may also further adapt or polish the initial generated privacy policy in editable HTML format before publishing. Consequently, the fingerprint keywords, even sentence-level segments, are not necessarily included in a generated app privacy policy sometimes.

# 4 Assessment of Privacy Policies (RQ3)
Generators are designed to generate compliant privacy policies. This section reports a detailed assessment of generated privacy policies.

# 4 Privacy Compliance Against Regulations
APPGs need to be designed in a way that allows developers to produce compliant privacy policies. Furthermore, they must be updated to reflect evolving laws. In Table 2, six APPGs claim that they are able to generate policies in compliance with CCPA and GDPR, and only #1 Iubenda mentions compliance with LGPD. However, their actual compliance with generated policies may be different from what they claim. Zimmeck et al.  conducted two studies in May 2020 and January 2021, revealing that some APPGs had significant compliance issues, such as failing to create CCPA-compliant policies. We perform a follow-up inspection in May 2022 based on generated privacy policies by Synthetic App 3, since
# Results
We employed the proposed methods to provide an estimation of the market penetration of APPGs. Among 46,472 valid privacy policy documents from apps at the Google Play Store, as shown in Table 4, we found 6% (3,066) privacy policies are highly likely generated by one of the APPGs by using fingerprint keyword searching and 18% (8,425) by using document similarity comparison. We also checked the intersection size, which is 4% (2,042), indicating that these two methods are complementary to each other. The union of the previous two methods is 20% (9,332), indicating an upper bound on possible market occupancy ratio. Overall, the results show that APPGs do play a considerable role in the current mobile app market.

# Finding 2
The market occupancy ratio of 10 examined APPGs is around 20%, and #2 App Privacy Policy Generator is the most popular one, boasting a 72% adoption rate. Moreover, users tend to select easy-to-use APPGs even though at the cost of a potentially-higher risk to breach privacy regulations.

The individual requirements of LGPD are shown in Table 5. “N.R.” stands for “no record”. The enforcement date of LGPD is September 2020.

They are supposed to comply with all compliance requirements of GDPR, CCPA, and LGPD Table 6 shows tallies of generators’ compliance with legal requirements in May 2020, January 2021, and May 2022 for GDPR, CCPA, and LGPD.

There is a notable discrepancy between the APPGs’ claimed ability to generate policies compliant with specific regulations and their actual compliance levels. In addition, across the table, compliance with GDPR and CCPA requirements improved over time from May 2020 to May 2022 for several APPGs (#3, #4, #7, #9), demonstrating an adaptation to regulatory standards. An encouraging observation is that APPGs (#1, #3, #4, #7, #8, #9) maintained full GDPR and a majority of CCPA compliance since January 2021. This might be due to the fact that GDPR has been in effect since 2018, providing APPGs with more time to adapt their policies accordingly. Given that LGPD came into effect in September 2020, it is not unexpected that compliance levels would be relatively low in the initial stages. The findings underscore the necessity for APPGs to improve their ability to produce compliant privacy policies consistently across all major regulations. The results also call for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of APPGs to ensure they keep pace with evolving laws and maintain transparency with their users regarding their actual capabilities.

APPGs have varying levels of compliance when it comes to data collection practices. For instance, while GDPR emphasises "Categories of personal data concerned", CCPA requires to provide a detailed list of categories of personal information that should be disclosed if collected. APPGs #1, #3, #4, and #7 demonstrate compliance with GDPR’s requirements, but when it comes to CCPA’s detailed disclosure requirements, only APPGs #3, #7, and #9 comply. As for third-party data-sharing and data-sale practices, CCPA’s emphasis is on "List of categories of personal information collected and sold" highlights this; whilst GDPR identifies “Recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data”. APPGs #1, #3, #4, and #7 have clear disclosures in line with third-party disclosure, but others like #2 and #5 lag behind. Overall, APPGs #3 and #7 consistently fare well across all three regulations, indicating a comprehensive privacy policy generation. However, APPGs #2, as the most popular, display apparent gaps compared to others.

# Data Right Coverage Analysis.

Regulations often necessitate data rights to grant sufficient choice and control to the end users over the personal data collected by businesses. Thus, it is important to assess whether the generated policies clearly disclose data rights. For this, following [GDPR Art] and
[CCPA §1798(a)(5)(A)]2, we extracted and summarised seven fundamental data rights. We manual examined the existence of disclosure for each data right of 10 APPGs. For comparison, we also scrutinized 12 leading mobile apps, which are mentioned in Section 2-Readability. These 12 leading apps are in various categories and published by different companies, with over one billion installations. Table 7 shows that almost all leading apps disclose fundamental data rights in their privacy policies. In addition, results validate the respective assertions made by APPGs, regarding their self-claimed compliance with GDPR and CCPA. Notably, #2 as the most popular APPG, does not disclose any of the data rights in the generated policy document.

Privacy Practice Disclosure Analysis. In alignment with the principles of data protection and transparency, it is also imperative that privacy policies encompass disclosure of privacy practices. Based on  and , this study delineates four highly concerning privacy practices. These are: 1) Data Encryption: Users’ data are encrypted and transferred over a secure connection. 2) Government Requests: It refers to the potential for government entities to request access to users’ data for various reasons, including national security or criminal investigations. 3) Data Breach Notification: In the event of a data breach where users’ information is compromised, it is essential to have a mechanism in place to notify affected users promptly. 4) Changes Notification: The privacy policy should mention the procedures for notifying users about significant changes to the policy, including how and when users will be informed. Then, we manually scrutinized the existence of disclosure across 10 APPGs and the same 12 leading apps. Table 8 shows that more than half APPGs disclose Data Encryption and Changes Notification. Five APPGs include Government Requests and only #8 includes Data Breach Notification in the generated policy document (“In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals...”). In addition, #5 and #6 do not include any privacy practice, and #8 includes all items. Furthermore, #2 as the most popular APPG, only include Data Encryption.

# Finding 3:
Noncompliance with privacy laws and under-claiming issues indicate potential need for a more stringent evaluation of APPGs’ capabilities.

# 4 Permissions Coverage Analysis
Device (sensor) permissions enable features of mobile apps and are normally critical in terms of personal privacy risks. Intuitively and legally, an app’s privacy policy should accurately disclose its permission usages; however, it is common that developers do not list all the permissions of their app in the privacy policy . Developers of mobile apps in the Google Play app store are required to clearly list the permissions they intend to obtain on their homepages3, and we denote them as Pclaimed. By taking the self-reported device permission usage as the ground-truth, we then assess whether the APPG’s provided UIs, questionnaires, or documents can sufficiently allow the APPGs users to enter permission invocation information by their app. Notably, the self-reported device permission usages by developers may not actually reflect the actual privacy behaviour of apps.

To scrutinise how developers translate used device permissions into policies by APPGs, for each permission (per), we use it and Synthetic App 1 to generate a privacy policy (PPApp1+per). By comparing the differences between PPApp1+per and PPApp1, we can locate and obtain the phrases/sentences each APPG uses to declare each permission in the privacy policy. For each app, by searching and counting the corresponding phrases/sentences in its privacy policy, we obtain the number of permissions displayed and denoted as Pdisplayed. For each app that uses the APPG, its Precognised is equal to the recognised dangerous permissions enumerated in Table 3. Then, we introduce two metrics for the extent to which APPGs cover claimed permissions in the generated privacy policy, as follows:
Recognised Coverage (RC) = 1∑PrecognisednPdisplayed
A higher RC indicates the app developers use the APPG more.
