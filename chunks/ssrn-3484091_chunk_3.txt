# Product Development and Manufacturing
As far as product development and manufacturing is concerned few things are important and among these valuable are—
- Deleting debug mode is very important in the mobile phones. This mode needs to removed in the devices before its sell to the consumer. Today one manufacturer developed lot of devices and sometimes they sold it in debug mode; so these should be keep in mind carefully.

- During the selling of a smart phone it is essential to keep that in Default setting; otherwise that can led Denial of Service attack.

- The smart phone market is emerging and with lots of applications. It is worthy to note that the security audits of applications are very important and valuable otherwise the whole system may be corrupted or infected.

- Every applications in the android system is asked for permission during its installation and thus during such activity it is essential to read the content carefully and if found unethical or suspicious information.

- Revocation procedure is another one in android system and can be managed by the app provider or system administrator; here uninstall of the app is possible globally. Hence this way security can be ensured.

- Avoid heavily customized systems, may have dual effect of risking the introduction of new bugs in the system and it is an important security concern.

- The updates of the software or patches must be come with the documentation by the manufacturer. Hence by reading everything one can update the systems easily.

# User Awareness—
User awareness is very important for running safe and secure android based system. It is a fact that most of the users are not read carefully the messages and details of the applications. Here application provider reputation, security messages, agreement messages are very important. Even there may be some software or application with intentions of phishing etc. Caring the phone with the owner is also important security measure in some cases. Different organizations and association has provided different framework and guidelines all of these need to follow by different stakeholders (refer fig: 2 for details). Different apps and system need to closedown if not required viz.—
- Digital camera
- GPS
- Bluetooth interface
- USB interface
- Removable storage etc.

Moreover latest android phones are come with inbuilt encryption systems with this it may be difficult to hack the systems or lose the information. Here the system may be encrypt or SD card etc.

# Centralized Storage Systems—
Sometimes it is better to keep the data and all the text in the company server and storage systems instead of Third Party Company or even own mobile devices.

# 8. Conclusion
As a whole Mobile Security needs different counter measures and defending mechanisms but still there are certain issues for which it is difficult to perform the security. And among these few important are Operating Systems. It is worthy to note that, few operating systems are single tasking hence such are not capable to do the task along with firewall or antivirus. Energy autonomy is another important concern that should be kept in mind. It is worthy to note that, network utilization should not be too high for the security reason. Apart from the technological countermeasure, it is essential to have users' interest and awareness for the security related concern. Moreover, few things are essentials viz. rich operating systems, secure operating systems, secure element, secure applications etc.
