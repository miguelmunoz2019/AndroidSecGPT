# Improper Access
A significant aspect of customers’ concern is related to their doubt about whether mobile app service providers have enough ability to prevent unauthorized access to their personal information . Individuals are fully sensible of such threat to the extent that monetary incentives would not diminish their concerns about unauthorized access to their information which individuals share with a third party . Improper access is known for its effect on privacy concern, but we believe it also comes with an influence on perceived security . By extension, we anticipate improper access negatively affects perceived security. Consequently, we hypothesize that:
# H5:
Improper access has a negative impact on the perceived security of mobile apps.

# H6:
Improper access has a positive impact on perceived privacy concerns of mobile apps.

We also adopt several control variables in our study based on privacy and security literature to examine the relationships of our model rigorously. We included age, gender, internet experience, invasion of security, and media exposure as the control variables in the proposed model.

# Methodology
The target population of this study is mobile app users in the U.S. An online survey would be administered through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Prior literature emphasized that mTurk is reliable, easy to access, affordable, and superior to both the traditional data collection methods and other similar digital respondents’ pools . In designing the survey, we adopt the previously developed measures for perceived security, trust, privacy concerns, privacy policy effectiveness, and improper access from the prior literature. The process of data collection involves: (1) a preliminary pilot study with less than 50 mobile apps users (university students) to get feedback about the questions; and (2) distributing the revised survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk among mobile apps users so that we can collect data from mobile apps users with different gender, age groups, and educations. Finally, we use multivariate techniques, especially structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze the research model after reliability and validity checks.

# Discussion and Conclusion
The key objective of this paper is to develop and test a nomological model to understand what factors influence the security perceptions of mobile apps users. The model posits that perceived trust, perceived privacy policy effectiveness, perceived privacy concerns, and improper access affect mobile app users’ security perception. We contribute to mobile apps security literature by employing privacy-related factors as the predictors of security perception. By mitigating the security concerns of mobile apps users, developers can eliminate barriers and hurdles that can change the users’ decision to discontinue the use of mobile apps. We recommend that future researchers dedicate more attention to the role of security which seems to remain an issue as technology moves forward.
