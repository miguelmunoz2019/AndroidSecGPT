# VI. RELATED WORK
Various studies emphasize the security problems brought by third-party libraries. Researches showed that third-party library would leak privacy, abuse permissions, and even bring security vulnerabilities. Erik et al. proposed the library outdateness problem in Android and even explored the reasons. We verify their findings in our experiments and we firstly propose the solution for the library outdateness problem. These security problems have motivated approaches to detect third-party libraries. Approaches were early proposed which select package name as a simple feature. Some other works are based on machine learning or code clustering, which extract features from app code. LibScout use class hierarchy as feature which is extracted.

# VII. CONCLUSION
This paper proposes APPCOMMUNE, an automated system to achieve a third-party library sharing strategy. APPCOMMUNE separates all third-party libraries from apps on the server side, and centrally manages the libraries on client side. Multiple apps would share one library which can avoid duplicated libraries and save the bandwidth as well as storage. The managed libraries are automatically updated, which reduces the threats of vulnerabilities in outdated third-party libraries. Our experiment demonstrates that APPCOMMUNE is a feasible management and it can effectively help update the third-party libraries and reduce the file size of apps..
