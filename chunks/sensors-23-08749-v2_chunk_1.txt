# Abstract
This research paper investigates the integration of blockchain technology to enhance the security of Android mobile app data storage. Blockchain holds the potential to significantly improve data security and reliability, yet faces notable challenges such as scalability, performance, cost, and complexity. In this study, we begin by providing a thorough review of prior research and identifying critical research gaps in the field. Android’s dominant position in the mobile market justifies our focus on this platform. Additionally, we delve into the historical evolution of blockchain and its relevance to modern mobile app security in a dedicated section. Our examination of encryption techniques and the effectiveness of blockchain in securing mobile app data storage yields important insights. We discuss the advantages of blockchain over traditional encryption methods and their practical implications. The central contribution of this paper is the Blockchain-based Secure Android Data Storage (BSADS) framework, now consisting of six comprehensive layers. We address challenges related to data storage costs, scalability, performance, and mobile-specific constraints, proposing technical optimization strategies to overcome these obstacles effectively. To maintain transparency and provide a holistic perspective, we acknowledge the limitations of our study. Furthermore, we outline future directions, stressing the importance of leveraging lightweight nodes, tackling scalability issues, integrating emerging technologies, and enhancing user experiences while adhering to regulatory requirements.

# 1. Introduction
# 1. General Context
The mobile applications (apps) industry is constantly evolving, with new advancements and trends appearing on a regular basis [1–3]. There has been a recent trend toward developing more advanced secure apps that incorporate artificial intelligence [4–7]. Furthermore, businesses have increasingly turned to mobile apps for e-commerce, offering their products and services through exclusive, secure mobile platforms. The widespread use of smartphones has greatly aided the expansion of the mobile app market . These devices, which combine the features of a computer with the portability of a cell phone, have become an essential part of many people’s daily lives. As a result, there has been an increase in demand for secure apps that can be used on these devices.

The presence of malicious apps designed to steal sensitive information or spread malware is a major issue . Another issue is the possibility of insecure data storage and transmission, which exposes sensitive information to malicious individuals . Addressing these security concerns in the mobile app market is critical, as mobile device

and app usage is expected to rise in the coming years . Neglecting these security concerns can have serious consequences, including the loss of sensitive information and financial harm to both individuals and organizations, potentially resulting in data breaches, identity theft, and financial losses . Furthermore, there are concerns about data privacy because many apps collect and share personal information without the user’s knowledge or consent.

In blockchain-based systems, the data is stored in distributed ledgers, verified through network nodes by consensus algorithms constituting a decentralized system and affording users’ trust. These systems store data in an encrypted and immutable manner to provide security. They manage the data across all of the nodes in a peer-to-peer network, so there is no possibility for a single point of failure which ensures integrity in the network. They process data easily, saving time and giving control to the user rather than to a centralized authority, providing simplicity; finally, the use of encryption and digital signatures via blockchain technology provides the user with privacy [19–26]. It is expected that blockchain technology will be the future of mobile apps.

# 1. Motivation and Main Contributions
The use of mobile apps to store sensitive information such as personal identification documents, financial information, and medical records has grown in popularity, making data storage security in these apps a critical concern. Data storage security entails safeguarding data against unauthorized use, disclosure, modification, disruption, or destruction. As a result, it is critical to ensure that this information is securely stored and protected from unauthorized access. The purpose of this paper is to identify any challenges or limitations associated with the use of blockchain technology in the security of Android mobile app data storage. The focus on Android is justified by its status as the dominant mobile operating system worldwide, commanding nearly 70% of the market share . Furthermore, statistical reports from Statista indicate that Android is also the most vulnerable operating system.

Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:
1. Providing an overview of the state-of-the-art in blockchain technology integration with mobile app data storage security.

2. Identifying the limitations and challenges of using blockchain technology for mobile app data storage security.

3. Identifying the future directions of blockchain technology.

4. Suggesting optimization strategies to overcome the limitations discussed.

5. Proposing a Blockchain-based Secure Android Data Storage (BSADS) framework.

# 1. Security Issues and Measures
Mobile threats are classified as web-based, app-based, network-based, or physical in nature. Device loss or theft, mobile malware, spyware, untrusted applications, storing sensitive information without proper encryption, poor authentication and authorization, unwanted calls and SMS, phishing, rooting, privacy breaches, vulnerable development, and weak default configurations are examples of these threats . These threats pose risks such as data loss, identity theft, financial fraud, unauthorized access to sensitive information, and device and data damage. With so many challenges, it is necessary to implement strong security measures to protect mobile devices and their data. Kaspersky discovered nearly 3 million malware apps on over 1 million devices in 2014. By 2017, Kaspersky’s in-lab detection technologies were processing 360,000 malicious files per day, with malware programs accounting for 78% of those files. This means that over 280,000 malware files were detected every day, with many of them aimed at mobile devices. According to Kaspersky, the following are the top seven mobile device threats: unsecured Wi-Fi, data leakage, network spoofing, spyware, phishing attacks, broken cryptography, and improper session handling.

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) also gathered information about security vulnerabilities and published a list of the top ten risks for mobile devices . The threats are categorized as follows: improper platform usage, insecure communication, insecure authentication, lack of cryptography, insecure authorization, poor client code quality, code manipulation, reverse engineering and insecure data storage [32–34]. Real-life examples of mobile app security breaches serve as cautionary tales for developers and users alike. One instance involved a security flaw in Amazon’s Ring Neighbors app, which exposed the precise locations and home addresses of users who made public posts, even though the posts were originally meant to be public but not location-specific. Another incident occurred with the Slack mobile app, which inadvertently logged user credentials in clear text on devices, prompting affected users to change their passwords. SHAREit, a popular Android file-sharing app with over 1 billion downloads, faced vulnerabilities that allowed for the execution of malicious code on smartphones for an extended period before being patched. Furthermore, 13 Android apps utilizing insecure third-party cloud services put the personal information of up to 100 million users at risk. ParkMobile experienced a breach affecting up to 21 million users, attributed to the improper handling of third-party software, leading to a class-action lawsuit. Klarna’s mobile banking app also suffered a security breach due to human error, temporarily exposing account information to other users. Lastly, hackers exploited the design flaws of the Portpass Canadian COVID vaccination passport app, compromising the privacy of 650,000 users due to unencrypted personal data . These incidents underscore the need for mobile app developers to prioritize security, undergo comprehensive training, and address data storage challenges with utmost seriousness.
