# ABSTRACT
Families are increasingly using Family Locator (FL) apps for convenience and safety purposes. Such FL apps often collect a lot of sensitive information, such as user location and contacts, to improve their usability and functionality. However, it is not clear if they provide strong protections to the collected sensitive information or not. This paper presents the findings on the first security and privacy analysis of FL apps. We select 41 FL apps from the Google Play store. We first analyze the permissions requested by the FL apps to understand the types of sensitive information they would collect. Then, we analyze the network traffic and local storage of these apps to identify potentially sensitive information leakage. Our analysis demonstrates that significant security and privacy vulnerabilities exist among FL apps. Specifically, 80% of the 41 FL apps leak sensitive information or join codes in plaintext. A join code would allow an attacker to join a family’s group to perform a wide range of malicious activities. Meanwhile, we found that 15% of the 33 apps leak sensitive information from their back-end servers due to authentication and authorization vulnerabilities. We provide suggestions to users and developers of FL apps to improve security and privacy. We responsibly disclosed our findings to the developers of the 33 vulnerable apps. Nine of the developers confirmed our findings and showed interest in addressing them in their next updates. The feedback from our responsible disclosures shows that our analysis makes an impact on the security and privacy of FL apps.

# 1 INTRODUCTION
Family Locators (FL) apps allow sharing location and other information of users in a group (family) for convenience and safety purposes. Some FL apps also allow remote activation of the microphone or camera on another family member’s device. For example, parents can be kept apprised of their children’s surroundings in addition to their actual location. FL apps also have other features like the ability to designate an area as a danger zone. With this feature, parents receive a notification whenever a child or some other family member enters a designated danger zone. Other features include the ability to monitor battery status and save location history. Currently, FL apps are not used exclusively for normal family communication, but can also be used to monitor other vulnerable individuals, such as people with mental or physical disabilities. Such individuals might require special oversight, and FL apps can greatly support their safety and well-being.

When it comes to using technology that collects data about individuals, privacy concerns arise. In the United States and Europe, there are some privacy regulations to restrict the use of personal data. One of the privacy regulations is Children’s Online Privacy Protection (COPPA). COPPA is to regulate how mobile apps or websites collect online information about kids under 13 years. COPPA states that mobile apps should get parents’ consent before they start collecting, using, or disclosing personal information about their kids. This includes geolocation, address, and multimedia data. COPPA also states that mobile apps should maintain the confidentiality and integrity of children’s information. If mobile apps violate any part of COPPA, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) might issue a fine as a penalty against the developers for violation. FL apps collect a lot of data about kids, and developers should pay close attention to not violate such regulations.

FL apps are unlike traditional apps. Traditional apps collect sensitive information about individuals. However, FL apps collect sensitive information about individuals and their family members. If an FL app stores or transfers sensitive information such as personally identifiable information (PII) in an insecure format, the whole family will be exposed. To illustrate, if criminals are able to access location information about the whole family, their house can be targeted while the family is away. Moreover, FL apps use join codes (secret codes) to invite people into circles (groups) for the purpose of sharing location and interacting. Anyone with a join code can enter the family circle and access the location of all the members as well as read all messages in the group’s chat.

Recent articles in the news have shown that an FL app suffers from issues related to security and privacy. It reported that one particular FL app leaked a massive amount of sensitive information ranging in type from personal data to corporate secrets of more than 238,000 users. The main cause of the data breach was that a vulnerability was exploited in the app’s server. Additionally, FL

Apps might leak sensitive information at rest (device storage) or in transfer over the network. FL join codes and other personal data can be exposed to cybercriminals if appropriate protection measurements are not in place. The attacker in this scenario may employ either a local or network attack to stealthily obtain or interfere with communications of the group. Therefore, FL apps need to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of user data, particularly when information, such as a join code, is being transmitted or stored.

This research aims to analyze the security and privacy of FL apps on the Android platform. Specifically, it analyzes certain critical channels of the apps that might be exploited. We monitor and analyze the communication between mobile devices and the corresponding back-end servers to determine whether user data is being transferred securely. Also, we analyze the use of local storage to determine whether user data is stored in an adequately secure fashion. The research question is: Do family locator (FL) apps protect family data?
A number of related studies [5, 6, 10 – 12, 18] have investigated the security and privacy protections in banking, mobile health (m-health), and dating apps. However, research in the category of FL apps is lacking, and the security and privacy features of FL apps have yet to be analyzed. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to examine FL apps from the security and privacy perspectives.

To answer our research question, a static analysis approach like in  could be used to trace sensitive information in the FL apps. However, the main drawback of static analysis is that it is susceptible to false positives. In addition, code obfuscation techniques, which are commonly used in apps, affect the accuracy of static analysis. As a result, it is hard to analyze certain vulnerabilities such as join code leakage simply by code analysis.

In this work, we use a dynamic analysis approach to overcome the drawbacks of static analysis. We take a semi-automated approach to investigate the security and privacy issues in FL apps. First, we identify candidate apps by crawling Google Play with the keyword phrase “family locator” which allows us to identify 41 candidate FL apps. These apps have millions of installs. Then, we extract a list of permissions from the Android Manifest file of each app to understand what types of sensitive data they gather. Subsequently, we install each app on two devices to simulate family member interactions. In this step, it is necessary to manually interact with the app to establish an account, create a circle, and invite group members into that circle. Lastly, we leverage the network traffic and local storage of each app to evaluate and analyze their security and privacy functions.
