# Abstract
Mobile applications are used for accomplishing everyday life activities, such as shopping, banking, and social communications. To leverage the features of mobile apps, users often need to share sensitive information. However, recent research demonstrated that most of such apps present critical security and privacy defects. In this context, we define as vulnerability-proneness the risk level(s) that users meet in downloading specific apps, to better understand whether (1) users select apps with lower risk levels and if (2) vulnerability-proneness of an app might affect its success. We use as proxy to measure such risk level the “number of different types of potential security issues exhibited by the app”. We conjecture that the vulnerability-proneness levels may vary based on (i) the types of data handled by the app, and (ii) the operations for which the app is supposed to be used. Hence, we investigate how the vulnerability-proneness of apps varies when observing (i) different app categories, and (ii) apps with different success levels. Finally, to increase the awareness of both users and developers on the vulnerability-proneness of apps, we evaluate the extent to which contextual information provided by the app market can be exploited to estimate the vulnerability-proneness levels of mobile apps. Results of our study show that apps in the Medical category exhibit the lowest levels of vulnerability-proneness. Besides, while no strong relations between vulnerability-proneness and average rating are observed, apps with a higher number of downloads tend to have higher vulnerability-proneness levels, but lower vulnerability-proneness density. Finally, we found that apps’ contextual information can be used to predict, in the early stages, the vulnerability-proneness levels of mobile apps.

# 1 Introduction
Nowadays, mobile applications are widely adopted in most of our everyday activities. About 2 and 2 million apps are currently available for download on Google Play Store and Apple App Store, respectively,1 with worldwide users relying on mobile applications to deal with a lot of professional and personal tasks, such as shopping, banking, social communication, and events organization . However, as reported by Gartner, a well-known market research organization, several popular apps typically process a lot of sensitive data (e.g., user’s location, lists of contacts, personal photos, etc.), providing often a little or no security assurances  due to either inappropriate implementations or poor design choices.

Previous studies demonstrated that the users’ perception, satisfaction, and judgments of mobile apps is influenced by many factors related to app development, such as (i) the change- and fault-proneness of adopted APIs , (ii) the complexity of users interfaces , (iii) the app size , and (iv) the amount of promotional images on the web-store pages (that could represent a proxy for estimating the amount of different functionalities provided by the app) . Complementary to what reported also by Gartner, recent research (Taylor and Martinovic 2017a; Aliasgari et al. 2018), conducted on popular apps handling sensitive user data (i.e., Financial and Health apps), demonstrated that the vast majority of mobile apps tend to suffer from security and/or privacy issues.

In general, consumers are less likely to rely on products experiencing privacy flaws . However, from a practical point of view it is not clear the extent to which (i) the users are aware of the risks they tackle while using insecure mobile applications  and (ii) the extent to which vulnerability risk level(s) of a mobile app can hinder its success. We argue that users tend to be unaware of the risks concerning downloading and using apps of different categories, and this assumption is also based on the fact that mobile apps generally receive few user reviews related to security and privacy concerns . Moreover, app details shared in app stores rarely provide (or do not provide) information about the “security risks associated to the usage of certain apps”.

In this context, we define as vulnerability-proneness the risk level(s) that users meet in downloading specific apps. Thus, we consider, in this paper, as proxy to measure the vulnerability-proneness of an app, “the set of the different types of potential security defects exhibited by the app”. We argue that higher vulnerability-proneness levels may result in a higher probability (or potential) of an app of being attacked, as a larger attack surface (i.e., the set of different ways in which an adversary might cause damage Manadhata and Wing, 2011) is exposed. This means that, vulnerability-proneness measures the range of different opportunities malicious users can attempt to exploit for triggering an attack. More specifically, rather than summarizing the proportion of flawed code units, vulnerability-proneness is more oriented at modeling the attack surface potential hackers have, by only quantifying vulnerabilities of different natures that could be likely exploited. For instance, given a specific vulnerability type, Vt, vulnerability-proneness does not report how many times vulnerabilities of the Vt type were found in the app’s code, but it only accounts that the app is vulnerable to the specific kind.

of weakness Vt. In this paper, we propose to answer the following and rising questions concerning the vulnerability-proneness of app that, to the best of our knowledge, no prior work investigated:
- Do users actually select apps exhibiting low security risks? What are the existing (if any) relationships among (in)security issues and app success (i.e., rating and downloads)?
Mobile app vulnerabilities have been explored from various research perspectives. For example, research literature proposed (i) comprehensive analyses of specific vulnerability types (Chin et al. 2011; Clark and van Oorschot 2013; Zhou and Jiang 2013), (ii) approaches and tools for automatically detecting security flaws , (iii) enhancements to current security models , and (vi) investigations on app vulnerabilities evolution (Gao et al. 2019; Taylor and Martinovic 2017b). Nevertheless, little attention has been paid to better understand how and to what extent security risks can affect the success of mobile apps. To fill this gap, this paper answers the aforementioned general questions, by proposing the following contributions:
- we first study (i) the most widespread vulnerability warnings exhibited by about 1,000 apps mined from the official Google app market, and (ii) the diffusion of specific vulnerability warning types over different app categories;
- we investigate the extent to which the vulnerability-proneness influences app success. Previous work  demonstrated that successful apps have more dependence on libraries. As third party code may represent the main carrier of app vulnerabilities , we aim at understanding whether apps with higher success are more or less prone to security flaws;
- we evaluate the extent to which an app’s contextual information (e.g., app metadata, such as app category, permissions required, etc.) can be used for automatically identifying, in early stages, its vulnerability-proneness, with the benefit of estimating the security and privacy concern levels, without the need of downloading or inspecting the actual app executables or sources.

Our investigation is conducted according to the overarching hypothesis that user perception of app (in)security levels may vary based on (i) the types of data handled by the app, as well as (ii) the app usage scenario. For instance, users may be more concerned to use an insecure app to access their bank account rather than sharing their position when using a flawed navigator app. We argue that these factors strictly depend on the actual app category, as apps belonging to different categories deal with different users’ data and present different user diffusion/popularity levels.
