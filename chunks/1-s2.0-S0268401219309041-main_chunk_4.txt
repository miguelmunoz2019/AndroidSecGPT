# 3. Privacy awareness
One of the reasons why individuals have different privacy concerns about the same phenomena is their varying levels of privacy awareness. For example, Smith et al. (2011) argue that individuals who are aware that some websites and applications may collect their personal information without their permission have more privacy concerns than individuals who are not aware of such malicious activities. Privacy awareness refers to the degree to which a person is aware of information privacy practices in general and the use of this by mobile apps . To illustrate, an individual’s privacy awareness is increased by reading and watching news, reading books and magazines, and hearing about privacy issues from friends or other people within their social bubble. In effect, privacy awareness can influence an individual’s attitude and perceptions toward mobile apps.

Privacy awareness exerts an influence on privacy-related perceptions because an individual’s awareness stimulates their protective behaviors . The difference in users’ levels of privacy awareness leads to different privacy and security perceptions of mobile apps (Acquisti & Gross, 2006). Therefore, privacy awareness increases or decreases the strength of the relationship between privacy-related concerns and security. For example, users with a higher level of privacy awareness perceive mobile apps to have lower security because they have read or heard more about unauthorized information disclosure incidents and know that such incidents transpire frequently with less secure mobile apps. Similarly, users with a higher level of privacy awareness assume that privacy policy statements that incorporate privacy and security practices are not necessarily an indicator of the higher level of mobile app security, due to the prevalence of privacy and security incidents despite the providers’ protection efforts. Thus, we hypothesize that:
# H4a.

A user’s perceived privacy awareness moderates the effect of perceived privacy risk on the perceived security of apps, such that the relationship is stronger when perceived privacy awareness is high.

# H4b.

A user’s perceived privacy awareness moderates the influence of the perceived effectiveness of the privacy policy on the perceived security of apps, such that the relationship is weaker when perceived privacy awareness is high.

# 3. Information sensitivity
Although there is a wide range of mobile applications (e.g., games, lifestyles, financial, utility, and education), the sensitivity of the information given to each app is different. Users have different privacy and security perceptions toward information disclosure based on the type of information shared with each app. That is, individuals are more concerned about releasing information to financial apps than fitness or game apps. Malhotra et al. (2004) argue that users have different levels of concerns when sharing more sensitive information, finding that when users are requested to provide more sensitive information, they perceive a higher risk and have lower intentions to disclose the requested information. Despite the importance of information sensitivity in privacy research, prior research on mobile apps does not consider the effect of information sensitivity on privacy-related relationships (Keith et al., 2016; Nikkhah & Sabherwal, 2017a; Xu et al., 2009). This study fills this gap by categorizing mobile apps as more sensitive information apps (e.g., financial apps) and less sensitive information apps (e.g., notetaking apps).

In general, sharing more sensitive information with mobile apps causes users to be more concerned, because if the shared information is disclosed to third-parties, users must deal with consequences that can disrupt their daily lives When users are required to provide more sensitive information, they become more conscious of the consequences of disclosing information to mobile apps. When a mobile app requests access to the mobile device’s location service, to track users’ locations, users focus more attention on giving such permission . Thus, users with the same perceptions of privacy risk perceive mobile apps that request more sensitive information to have lower security, because they expect these apps to be more secure than apps requesting less sensitive information. For instance, users expect financial apps to be more secure than games, but when users perceive the same level of risk with financial apps and games, they perceive financial apps to have lower security. With the same logic, when users are required to provide more sensitive information, the presence and understanding of a privacy policy becomes more important and users consider the privacy policy more. Hence, the effect of a privacy policy on the risk and security perceptions of mobile apps becomes stronger when users need to provide more sensitive information. Prior privacy studies have considered the moderating role of information sensitivity in privacy-related relationships and found that perceptions pertain to information disclosure changes when users disclose more sensitive information (Okazaki, Li, & Hirose, 2009). As a result, we consider the moderating role of information sensitivity and hypothesize that:
# H5a.

Information sensitivity moderates the relationship between perceived privacy risk and the perceived security of mobile apps, such that the relationship is stronger with more sensitive information.

# H5b.

Information sensitivity moderates the relationship between the perceived effectiveness of privacy policies and the perceived security of mobile apps, such that the relationship is weaker with more sensitive information.

# H5c.

Information sensitivity moderates the relationship between the perceived effectiveness of privacy policies and the perceived privacy risk of mobile apps, such that the relationship is stronger with more sensitive information.

# 4. Methods and data
We published two independent web-surveys on Amazon Mechanical Turk to reach a large sample of mobile app users of different genders,
2 For example, unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, such as a social security number and credit card information, can lead to identity theft and financial loss.

education levels, and age groups in the US, similar to prior studies on privacy and security perceptions (Dinev & Hart, 2006; Dinev et al., 2013; Hong & Thong, 2013; Lowry et al., 2011; Malhotra et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2011). The selection of Amazon Mechanical Turk for participant sampling has theoretical validity, as it is a sample of consumers or regular users and not specialized employees or individuals (Jia, Steelman, & Reich, 2017). We adapted the items in the survey from previously validated measures. Perceived security items were based on measures developed by Chellappa (2008). The measures of perceived privacy risk and perceived privacy awareness were adopted from Malhotra et al. (2004), and the measures of effectiveness of privacy policies were adopted from Xu et al. (2011). Seven-point Likert scales, with anchors ranging from ‘strongly disagree’ to ‘strongly agree’, were used for all items.

Before conducting the primary study, we conducted a pilot study to solicit feedback and revise the questions as necessary. Two IS researchers and four IS PhD students reviewed the instruments and assessed the length of the survey, the format, the face validity of the scales, and the clarity of the questions. We modified some of the questions to improve clarity, based on the pilot study feedback. The primary study involved launching two surveys on Amazon Mechanical Turk, with different wording, to target users of apps that collect more sensitive information and users of apps that collect less sensitive information. We asked the participants of the more-sensitive group whether they use or have used any mobile banking apps, such as Bank of America, Citibank, and Chase (this allowed us to remove participants who had never used or interacted with banking apps). Next, the participants were asked to consider their own banking app or one of the example mobile banking apps while answering the questions. For the less-sensitive group, we focused on one particular app, called Evernote, which is a notetaking app. We asked participants whether they use Evernote, to automatically preclude participants who had no experience using Evernote from participation. Then, the participants were asked to consider Evernote while answering the questions.

We encouraged participation in our study by using a small monetary incentive. Table A1 shows the survey for the more sensitive group. We replaced the references to mobile banking apps with references to Evernote for the less sensitive group. Mobile banking apps have access to users’ identification and financial information, home addresses, contact details, and social security numbers, while notetaking apps, such as Evernote, only request limited information from users. Overall, we received 1544 responses (all US participants) to both surveys, removing incomplete responses and those that were completed in under five minutes . We received 1046 usable responses, including 559 from the more sensitive group and 487 from the less sensitive group. Table 1 summarizes the demographics of the study participants.
