While this work addressed the fundamental research question: “how are the vulnerabilities of mobile apps associated with libraries?”, we can further generalize it to: “where do the vulnerabilities of mobile apps come from?”. There are many research aspects that could address this question; e.g., the app development environments, the economic models of mobile app ecosystems, the sources of information for coding, and the reuse of code. An in-depth study of such research aspects is left for future work.
