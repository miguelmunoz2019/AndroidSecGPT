Communicating mobile security threats and best practices has become a central objective due to the ongoing discovery of new vulnerabilities of mobile devices. To cope with this overarching issue, the goal of this paper is to identify and analyze existing threats and best practices in the domain of mobile security. To this extent, we conducted a literature review based on a set of keywords. -e obtained results concern recognizable threats and established best practices in the domain of mobile security. Afterwards, this outcome was put forward for consideration by mobile application users (n = 167) via a survey instrument. To this end, the results show high awareness of the threats and their countermeasures in the domain of mobile applications. While recognizing the risks associated with physical and social factors, the majority of respondents declared the use of built-in methods to mitigate the negative impact of malicious software and social-engineering scams. -e study results contribute to the theory on mobile security through the identification and exploration of a variety of issues, regarding both threats and best practices. Besides this, this bulk of up-to-date knowledge has practical value which reflects in its applicability at both the individual and enterprise level. Moreover, at this point, we argue that understanding the factors affecting users’ intentions and motivations to accept and use particular technologies is crucial to leverage the security of mobile applications. -erefore, future work will cover identifying and modeling users’ perceptions of the security and usability of mobile applications.

# 1. Introduction
Recent years have shown a significant increase in the popularity and ubiquity of mobile devices among users all around the globe . -ese devices, based on a specific operating system, enable users to install a vast variety of applications, commonly referred to as “apps,” from online sources called markets: Apple App Store, and Google Play . -e aforementioned apps are the essence of smartphones, enriching their functionality and enhancing the everyday lives of their users. -e app markets allow users to perform a quick search and installation of new apps, but at the same time, they are also a source of different kinds of malware disguised as normal apps. Nowadays, mobile devices are subject to a wide range of security challenges and malicious threats.

-e mobile revolution has empowered and influenced users to move almost all of their everyday operations into the mobile environment and so-called mobile applications. Hence, we can observe rapid growth in the domains of both mobile developers and users. Mobile devices are treated by their users as very personal tools, mainly used to facilitate everyday operations, but they also serve to store very sensitive personal information.

Contemporary mobile applications are ubiquitous and very easy to install on almost every mobile operating system: iOS, Android, Windows phone, etc. As a result of aggressive competition among application providers, we can observe more and more advanced and customized applications appearing on the market, resolving complex problems. -ese applications profoundly change a user’s behavior by facilitating their day-to-day transactions [5–8].

In recent years, mobile applications have had to face a wide variety of external and internal security threats [9–12]. To address this growing issue, both research studies and business organizations have developed and promoted best practices.

practices to this extent. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are few (if any) comprehensive studies which diagnose the status of knowledge within this domain from these two antagonistic objectives. Therefore, the goal of this study is to identify and analyze security threats to mobile applications on the one hand and contemporary best practices on the other hand. Therefore, we put forward the three following research questions:
- RQ1. What are the security threats to mobile applications?
- RQ2. What are the best practices to protect mobile applications?
- RQ3. Which best practices are in use and to what extent by mobile application users?
To answer RQ1 and RQ2, we performed a literature review based on a combination of the keywords “mobile application,” “threat,” and “best practice” in an electronic search with Google web search engine and Google Scholar. These two platforms promptly rose to become dominant providers of information and scholarly literature. While the former, in 2019, was a search engine leader worldwide, accounting for 88 percent of global market share , the latter is claimed to be the most comprehensive academic search engine, with 389 million records indexed . A critical analysis of the existing empirical evidence and state-of-the-art studies obtained results which contribute to a new understanding of mobile security threats and best practices.

To answer RQ3, we conducted an anonymous survey and asked mobile application users to fill in a questionnaire which was divided into two parts, where the first directly referred to the subject of the research and the second collected demographic data. In total, we examined the responses from 167 users regarding their adoption of ten mobile security best practices by users in Poland. The findings revealed a relatively high adoption level of security practices applied against a wide range of cyberattack vectors. Taking this into account, our contribution details the current state of the existing and applied security techniques, reflecting users’ attitudes toward mitigating (ignoring) risks and eliminating (neglecting) hazards regarding mobile application threats and vulnerabilities.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the research background and motivation. Section 3 provides a summary of the identified mobile security threats, whereas Section 4, in the same manner, reviews the best practices. Section 5 shows a comprehensive report from the conducted survey. Section 6 presents general discussion, along with the theoretical and practical implications, as well as the study limitations and future work agenda. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.

# 2. Research Background and Motivation
Mobile technology is a phenomenon which is strongly rooted in our everyday activity. More often than not, we are dependent on different kinds of applications, both for leisure (instant messaging, booking, maps, etc.) and for business (online banking, e-mail management, business functions, etc.). Users install mobile apps and provide their personal information while rarely thinking about security issues.

According to many researchers, the most influential factors which help the spread of mobile technology among customers are as follows :
1. Gaining access to information which is up to date: there is no more information asymmetry; instead, we can observe information democratization
2. Lower production costs, granted by the technology revolution: thus, products/services offered on the market are easier to deliver to the end consumer and, at the same time, more customized to meet individual requirements
3. Fast access to less biased market research: the personal character of mobile technology allows real-time information to be gathered about consumers based on their actual behavior
4. A shift from accessing only local markets to a global economy and digital channels, yet at the same time, thanks to the personal character of mobile technology, consumers may be accessed in a personalized way
5. A shift from mass markets to personal, one-2-one relations
6. A shift from “on time” to “right now” mobile technology which allows communication, no matter what localization and time and, at the same time, with customization of information observed never before
The other aspect which has created what we can observe nowadays as a new phenomenon, i.e., mobile communication, is the immanent characteristic of mobile/handheld devices, which will be discussed further. Consumers have gained access to a wide array of tools at their fingertips. In Figures 1 and 2, we can observe the market trend in the proliferation of mobile phone subscriptions. According to the Ericsson Mobility Report , we can observe a growth in mobile subscriptions starting in 2015 and predicted to reach nearly 9 billion mobile subscriptions in 2025.

The aforementioned report also shows the rapid increase in our consumption of information and points to constant growth in the number of mobile subscriptions and even quicker growth in the number of mobile broadband subscriptions (mobile broadband includes radio access technologies: 3G, 4G, 5G, CDMA20000 EV-DO, TD-SCDMA, and Mobile WiMAX).
