Potential beneficiaries of the study are far-reaching. Beginning with the OS developer, new insights may be gained on trends with reoccurring vulnerabilities. Future versions of the OS would have improved security posture if the developer used this insight to avoid recreating historical mistakes. Vendors utilizing the OS on their devices would benefit by using the new knowledge to improve the mitigation of vulnerabilities based on the trending analysis. Finally, the end user would benefit from an overall more secure device.

# Theoretical significance of the study
Theoretical significance of the study potentially demonstrates the ability of vendors and service providers to mitigate known vulnerabilities addressed by Google in the Android OS in current patch release cycles. Additionally, new detection mechanisms for vulnerabilities on Android devices that can be run ad-hoc on the device or remotely with low overhead that could be leveraged by future publicly available security suites.

# Practical significance of the study
The practical significance of the study potentially increases user’s awareness of mobile device security by demonstrating the vulnerabilities detected on their devices and the potential for loss of sensitive data on platforms assumed to be secure. Additionally, the study provides an accurate sample of vulnerabilities found in recent instances of the Android OS between versions 6.x and 11.x on devices being utilized in the wild.

# Nature of Study
The research method will be quantitative for the study. A quantitative study will allow for the accurate measurement of vulnerabilities that have been addressed in patches from Google or by mitigations from vendors but not resolved on the end consumer device. The research design that will best facilitate is a case study. As stated by Creswell, “the study of a case within a real-life contemporary context or setting” can provide insight into actual vulnerabilities in the wild. A case study will allow for trend analysis of vulnerabilities contextually. As stated by Yin (1994), a case study will allow for a systematic study using multiple sources of evidence. Additionally, the research can potentially extend or strengthen knowledge in the Android security focus area. Finally, previous research studies in similar areas can be leveraged for techniques and methods to determine the best approach for analyzing the data collected.

The research method of a purely quantitative study is appropriate due to the population being examined. The raw CVE details, CVSS scores, and NVD database are highly numeric in value, and precise measurements can be taken of the published vulnerabilities. Qualitative would leave more room for speculation; however, the study strives to be analytical. The grounded theory approach will enable the study to proceed in a systematic way.

The design will focus on the collection and organization of the raw vulnerability data. Additionally, the analysis of the data will help achieve the goal of the study by demonstrating potential trends and patterns stemming from historical findings and correlation with current and future vulnerability discoveries. Finally, a deeper analysis using a scoring metric such as the CVSS will allow additional insights into the severity of the vulnerabilities.

# Hypotheses/Research Questions
The main research question to be answered by the study is to what extent is the rate of vulnerabilities changing. Three sub-questions are sought to be answered in support of the main research question. First of the sub-questions, is to determine if each platform improved, which will help to create a system to gauge the progress of each platform. Next, has the posture improved over time will determine either the positive or negative rate of change over the given period. Finally, determining if any vendors are doing better than others through a ranking system will provide the ability to overlay the results from each platform’s improvements and security postures. The expected result will be a charted and graphed set of data to display the main question of vulnerability rate change.

Next, the question will be examined of how many vulnerabilities have gone unmitigated by vendor implementations of the Android OS on mobile devices running versions 6.x through 11.x after patches have been made publicly available by Google. Additionally, to what extent is the real-world impact in terms of exploitability and loss of elements of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad from vulnerabilities which have gone unmitigated by vendor implementations of the Android OS in current releases, ranging from versions 6.x through 11.x?
Utilizing the research methodology of quantitative analysis is to be followed by grounded theory. The grounded theory process is explained as a series of events or interactions which occur over a period of time . The correlation of CVE across multiple Android OS versions over a predefined time period fits the definition by Creswell (2005) for a basis to perform the study.

According to Salkind (2003), historical research, also known as historiography, seeks to answer the nature of past events. The study to be performed may not fit the research method of historiography, as the vulnerabilities, although exposed at a time in the past, are always present in a configuration without proper mitigations. It is surmised vulnerabilities remain existent in past, present, and future releases of OSs which may be due to the complexity of a vulnerability, negligence of developers, or other factors.

Descriptive research is defined by Salkind (2003) as having the purpose “to describe the current state of affairs at the time of the study.” As descriptive research attempts to understand current events  and the study will include past and present data, the descriptive methodology will not be a selected approach. The scope of time the study is, in essence, a disqualifier for selecting descriptive research.

The correlational research methodology was selected as it measures the strength of a relationship between two variables, known as the correlational coefficient . Salkind (2003) explains correlational research may result in the understanding of the commonality or predictability of an outcome with specified pieces of information . The correlational research method will allow the study proposed the desired result to analyze the trending of vulnerabilities and the predictability of future vulnerabilities.

Creswell (2005) states the case study methodology focuses on individuality rather than grouping . The proposed study seeks to analyze many vulnerabilities and a selected group of OSs. Due to the nature of the study’s scope, the case study methodology will sufficiently handle the data subset to be analyzed, such as limited vulnerabilities and OS versions.

In summary, grounded theory with a correlational and case study methodology is elected to be the research method of choice. As stated by Creswell (2005), grounded theory allows for a broad theory to be generated when no current theories answer the problem to be studied . The open nature of studying CVEs over a time period for previously unknown trends will seek to generate a new broad theory, which may result in future work.

# Conceptual Framework
The Android OS developed by Google is the most prolific OS across mobile devices. Other vendors support their own proprietary OSs, but Android’s open-source nature allows the OS to be widely adopted by various hardware manufacturers. As seen with the previously most popular desktop OS, Microsoft Windows is known to have a
A plethora of publicly available vulnerabilities and compiled exploits. This same issue plagues Android due to its wide availability, open-source nature, connectivity options, and ease of application deployability.

# 1. Availability of the Android OS
The open architecture allows vendors to compile the OS for their platform of choice. Under Google’s own brand of hardware, created by third-party vendors specifically to Google’s specifications, the Nexus brand of devices receives regular updates addressing known vulnerabilities under the tech goliath’s patch management cycle . Unfortunately, these updates do not get deployed to all vendor devices.

The work of Ratazzi (2016) states that mobile devices released by other vendors, such as Amazon, LG, or HTC, are restricted by multiple issues, limiting their ability to receive the hotfixes. First, regressions testing must be performed by the vendor to verify the compatibility with their release of the Android OS version. Additionally, vendor customizations may create new vulnerabilities not applicable to other versions of the same revision . Second, other providers are limited by the mechanisms to deliver updates to the devices. WiFi may be an option, but updates are often limited or delayed by a service provider, such as cellular carriers . Third, vendors do not have the desire to keep ageing devices updated with the latest releases, as the next wave of devices is always right around the corner. The consumer’s desire to continually upgrade to the latest technology leaves the vendors with no option but to move forward on only the most recent platforms, lest they take a hit to their profit on the bottom line.
