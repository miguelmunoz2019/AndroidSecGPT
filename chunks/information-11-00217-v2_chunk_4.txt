Both the BarSec Droid Android application and the BarSec desktop application support different digital signature algorithms i.e., RSA and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with several key lengths, and use SHA-256 as hash function (see Figure 3). They support hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) with different key lengths. In addition, they use Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with four modes; Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), Output Feedback (OFB), Cipher Feedback (CFB) and Galois/Counter Mode (GCM). These mechanisms have been studied in detail to meet the usability issues presented in . We have also implemented Access Control Lists (ACLs) that allow the generator to have multiple layers of data; i.e., multiple users who have controlled access to data.

Authentication, Data Integrity and Non-Repudiation Test: Guaranteed

# Example 1
As an example of use assume we have a QR code with the ACL that include these tags: public, student and teacher, where:
- Public tag: contains plain text data;
- Student tag: contains a ciphertext that is encrypted with the student key.

- Teacher tag: contains a ciphertext that is encrypted with the teacher key.

Each tag has authorized users who can access its contents, e.g., a student can read the public tag, and the student tag but not the teacher tag (since students do not have the teacher key).

summarizes the features of the BarSec Droid application. It uses the JSON structure, and it supports barcodes generated by the BarSec Droid Desktop application, and also barcodes that contain Access Control Lists (ACLs). It can read standard QR codes that do not include cryptographic data and that do not follow specific structures. It checks full URLs contained inside barcodes, and checks their online content using Norton Safe Web service.

# 6. Experimental Results
We have conducted a user survey to get the user reactions about the BarSec Droid usage, and the level of trust for the provided security information. In order to compare the results with other security apps, we have chosen the most popular and secure QR code reader, i.e., QR Droid Private  that belongs to the popular and Crypto-based protection group. We followed the recommended sample size in  and conducted a survey with the help of 30 users who were undergraduate students from different colleges. They were asked to scan ten QR codes for each reader. Then, the users completed a survey that was built following the lines of three very popular usability surveys [124 – 126] and a usability survey on secure mobile applications . Our survey includes the following ten points:
- Overall, I am satisfied with the ease of completing the tasks.

- Overall, I am satisfied with the amount of time it took to complete the tasks.

- Overall, I am satisfied with the support information (warnings and details messages).

- It is flexible?
- I would recommend it to a friend.

- I can effectively complete the tasks using this application.

- I am able to efficiently complete the tasks using this application.

- How much do you trust the security information in the application?
- Overall, I would like to use the application.

- Is the application visually appealing?
Each point had a five-point scale answer, described as: (1: very unsatisfied to 5: very satisfied). We have followed the answers evaluation method used on  by using paired t-test, which is a standard statistical method that compares the mean values of two groups. Paired t-test was used because the survey asked the user to evaluate 2 apps at a time.

shows the Means (the value before ±), Mean Standard Error ((MSE), the value after ±), and p-value results from participants’ feedback for BarSec Droid and QR Droid Private. Note that, in the t-test, when the p-value is less than 0, there is a statistically significant difference between two groups , and in this case the mean value is marked in bold in the table.

According to Table 7, BarSec Droid recorded better answers for easiness of use, security trust, being likely to use, recommended app, effectively and efficiently. On the other hand, QR Droid Private recorded a higher level of support information satisfaction and visually appealing, which reflects the application excellent design and options such as supporting multiple (29) languages. The results of the time of tasks and the flexibility recorded converged values, which reflects that BarSec Droid and QR Droid Private have acceptable time delay and flexible capabilities according to the user feedback.

# 7. Conclusions
This paper presents the most comprehensive evaluation for 100 barcode reader applications from a point of view of security and privacy issues. We have categorized these apps according to their features into five groups: URL security, Crypto-based security, Popular, Weak and, Save-privacy applications. Based on our analysis, we have proposed recommendations towards developing usable, secure and privacy-friendly applications and implemented BarSec Droid, a proof of concept Android app that follows our recommendations. Moreover, we have conducted user experiments to assess user experience on our app, compared to the most popular/secure QR code reader app. The results show that applying the design recommendations will increase the user security trust, ease of use alongside with the efficacy and effectiveness of scanning barcodes. As a future work, we plan to extend our analysis to cover more applications i.e., iOS and Windows phone apps. In addition, we plan to evaluate the available security mechanisms of QR code online contents such as: Google safe browsing and Norton Safe Web.
