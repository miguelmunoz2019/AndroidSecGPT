Various security measures can be implemented by developers, users, and app hosting providers to safeguard mobile devices from security threats . Developers play a critical role in ensuring app security by adhering to secure coding practices, including the use of robust cryptographic algorithms with long keys and TLS/SSL for secure communication. Regular issuance of security updates and the inclusion of security patches in their libraries are recommended practices. Users also have responsibilities in protecting their devices and data, such as keeping their operating systems and apps up to date, refraining from device rooting, and being cautious when installing unfamiliar apps. It is advisable for users to download apps exclusively from reputable sources like the Google Play Store, which conducts checks for malicious code. Downloading apps from third-party or internet sources can pose security risks.

Hosting providers, like the Google Play Store, serve as trustworthy platforms for Android apps and actively monitor and disable apps with security vulnerabilities. Using techniques such as static and partial dynamic analysis, this app store can assign security scores to mobile apps based on their security measures, potentially influencing developers to implement robust security practices to improve their apps’ visibility in searches and recommendations. This approach empowers users to make informed decisions about app installations based on their security scores. While millions of apps are available on the widely used Google Play Store, the exponential growth of mobile app usage has raised concerns about security. Vulnerabilities that expose sensitive information have been identified in many apps, and even official app stores have hosted malicious apps. To address these issues, mobile app developers and device manufacturers should consider various security measures, including the adoption of blockchain technology, as suggested by our study.

Many suggested solutions and recommendations have been made by researchers to enhance the security of data storage in Android OS. Physical and software threat solutions have been proposed, like using Clean OS, TinMan, Sentry, Armored, Deadbolt, and Droid-Vault for physical threats and Android Encryption for software threats . Still, more research is required as new technologies like blockchain are being developed to address the challenges facing data storage security and provide more secure, high-performance, scalable, cost-effective, and reliable data storage solutions.

# 2. Blockchain Technology and Data Storage
Blockchain technology was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 [38–41]. Blockchains are decentralized digital record-keeping systems that consist of transactions that are verified using cryptography and grouped together into blocks [42–45]. Together, the blocks are linked in a secure way, making it easy to detect any tampering . As more blocks are added, it becomes harder to make changes to older blocks, making the chain of blocks tamper-resistant. The ledger is duplicated across the network, and any discrepancies are automatically resolved based on established protocols . The general architecture of a blockchain is shown in Figure 1.

Away from blockchain technology, various approaches to data storage, including relational databases like MySQL or Oracle, NoSQL databases such as MongoDB or Cassandra, centralized storage solutions, and cloud-based storage solutions all offer a range of advantages and drawbacks. Relational databases provide strong consistency and transactional support but can be complex to manage and may not scale well for extensive datasets. NoSQL databases prioritize

flexibility and scalability but may sacrifice some consistency for performance and can be chal-
lenging to query and maintain. Centralized storage offers simplicity and high performance but
is vulnerable to security risks and lacks transparency. Cloud storage, while cost-effective and
convenient, raises concerns about data privacy and security due to offsite storage. In general,
the choice of data storage approach will depend on the specific needs and requirements, as
well as the available resources and expertise [48–53]. As we are concentrating on the use of
blockchain for data storage security, let us explore that thoroughly.

# 2. Blockchain Components
In this subsection, we delve into the core components of the blockchain system to gain
a better understanding of the technology . Transactions form the foundation of a
blockchain, as data is organized into blocks and arranged in a specific order . In decen-
tralized blockchain networks, transactions are initiated using private key cryptography,
initially stored in an unconfirmed transaction pool. These transactions undergo validation
by peers, and upon confirmation by miners and verification through the network’s consen-
sus mechanism, they are added to a block and subsequently included in the immutable
ledger maintained by each peer. Mining, a pivotal process, involves the validation and
addition of transaction records to blocks using linked-list-based data structures. Miners
undertake this task by solving computational puzzles through consensus algorithms like
Proof of Work (PoW). While this process continually expands the blockchain, valid solutions
can sometimes lead to delays or forks in the blockchain, with miners actively monitoring
the network to choose which fork to mine on. Blockchain maintenance, therefore, becomes
a collaborative and decentralized effort among miners . Achieving consensus poses
a unique challenge in a trustless environment with no centralized authority. Various con-
sensu protocols have been developed to address this challenge and ensure agreement
among nodes on the blockchain’s current state and the validity of new transactions. These
protocols draw parallels to the Byzantine generals problem, where generals must agree
despite potential traitors in their midst. Multiple consensus algorithms are employed in
blockchain systems, including Proof of Work (PoW), Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance
(PBFT), Tendermint, Proof of Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), each with
distinct characteristics and considerations. Finally, while not present in all blockchains,
smart contracts play a pivotal role in networks like Ethereum. Smart contracts are self-
executing agreements with contractual terms expressed in code . They can be stored
on blockchain networks and facilitate asset exchanges without intermediaries [60–66]. Fur-
thermore, smart contracts can serve as a means of data storage, encoding data directly
into the contract to create a tamper-proof and permanent record accessible and verifiable
by authorized parties using cryptographic keys. Smart contracts  offers a secure and
transparent approach to decentralized data storage in mobile apps. However, they are
not without limitations, such as deployment costs, execution complexity, and potential
code vulnerabilities.

# 2. Types of Blockchain Networks
The type of blockchain network can be determined by its permission model, which
decides who has the ability to maintain it (e.g., adding blocks).
