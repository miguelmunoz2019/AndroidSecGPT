With regard to prior privacy experience, Smith et al. (1996, p. 186) describe that “individuals who had been exposed to, or been the victim of, personal information misuses should have stronger concerns regarding information privacy”. In this regard, a distinction is made between personal experiences and indirect experiences, e.g., in the form of media messages about online privacy risks, which can be as effective as direct experiences because such messages may contain self-relevant information that exposes individuals’ personal privacy risks in online environments (Cho, Lee, & Chung, 2010; Smith et al., 1996; Xu, Gupta et al., 2012). Computer anxiety is defined as “the tendency of individuals to be uneasy, apprehensive, or fearful about current or future use of computers” (Stewart & Segars, 2002, p. 44). Further, Thatcher and Perrewé (2002, p. 384) relate computer anxiety to “fears about the implications of computer use such as the loss of important data or fear of other possible mistakes”. Such loss of important data can entail personal information that is tracked by using mobile applications, which may motivate mobile users “to avoid potential harm arising from ambiguous threat” (Yin, Bond, & Zhang, 2014, p. 542). In our context, mobile users could avoid potential harm by not accepting app permissions that require to access personal information such as mobile users’ location, contacts, and other privacy-related data. The third antecedent, perceived control, refers to “perceived control over personal information as an individual’s belief about the presence of factors that may increase or decrease the amount of control over the release and dissemination of personal information” (Xu, Gupta et al., 2012, p. 1346). Such factors may refer to consumers’ choices about the amount of information collected, e.g., through opt-in and opt-out options (Caudill & Murphy, 2000). For example, in the context of location-based services, users are given the choice to turn off the location tracking from their mobile devices, and thus, opt out from having their personal information transmitted to the service provider. Finally, we add app permission concerns as a new antecedent, which we argue is becoming more and

more important for information privacy concerns regarding the rapid growth of mobile apps and, subsequently, increasingly excessive app permissions. The justification for this addition will be provided in the next section, where we develop our hypotheses related to mobile users’ information privacy concerns.

# 3. Research model and hypothesis generation
Based on the APCO model, we present our research model in Fig. 2, which includes antecedents of information privacy concerns, i.e., prior privacy experience, computer anxiety, perceived control, and app permission concerns, which we propose as an additional antecedent in a mobile user context. Privacy concerns are implemented in the model in the form of mobile users’ information privacy concerns (MUIPC), which are formed by the dimensions of perceived surveillance, perceived intrusion, and secondary use of personal information. Finally, outcomes of privacy concerns are depicted through the intention to accept app permissions.

Considering the mobile context, MUIPC is in the heart of our research model, with prior privacy experience, computer anxiety, perceived control, and app permission concerns as its predictors. Prior privacy experience has been found to be a predictor of information privacy concerns in previous studies (Smith et al., 1996; Xu, Gupta et al., 2012; Xu, Gupta et al., 2012), and we expect that mobile users will have similar experiences with privacy-related issues, as recently supported by a study on mobile privacy concerns by Belanger and Crossler (2019). As such, mobile users will have stronger concerns regarding information privacy once their personal information has been misused in the past or they have heard or read about the use and potential misuse of the information collected from the Internet or through mobile applications. In such cases, mobile users perceive being a victim of personal information misuse, such as in the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica case described earlier, which leads to an increase of information privacy concerns (Borena, Belanger, Ejigu, & Anteneh, 2015; Zlatolas, Welzer, Heričko, & Hölbl, 2015). Thus, we propose the following hypothesis:
H1. Prior privacy experience positively influences mobile users’ information privacy concerns.

As previous studies have shown the impact of computer anxiety on information privacy concerns (Osatuyi, 2015; Stewart & Segars, 2002), we further anticipate that MUIPC will be influenced by computer anxiety. The construct of computer anxiety suggests that it is formed in response to perceived threats from a technology, which leads individuals to experience tension when exposed to computers (Brown, Fuller, & Vician, 2004; Kummer, Recker, & Bick, 2017). Since computer anxiety refers to the loss of important data or fear of other possible mistakes (Thatcher & Perrewé, 2002), we reason that mobile users’ computer anxiety will significantly affect their privacy concerns due to the high degree of sensitive data such as location information, contacts, photos, and other user-related data, which is transmitted through mobile devices. As computer anxiety increases, users may feel uncomfortable with excessive app permission requests and privacy concerns will increase. Therefore, we posit the following hypothesis:
H2. Computer anxiety positively influences mobile users’ information privacy concerns.

With regard to perceived control, we propose that mobile users will have similar fears about a potential misuse of personal data, e.g., through mobile apps that request access to users’ location, although the information is not required by the app. In this regard, app stores allow mobile users to control the amount of personal information. For example, Apple changed the privacy settings with the release of iOS 6, which gives mobile users a higher amount of control over their personal information. The change implied that mobile users can turn off access to contacts, calendars, reminders, photos, Bluetooth sharing, as well as access to Twitter and Facebook accounts. Before this change, users were only allowed to turn off access to location. Later versions of iOS allowed mobile users to control further categories such as opting out of access to the microphone and built-in camera of mobile devices. For Android 5 or lower, it was not possible to control individual app permissions. Google also gave users more control over permissions with the release of Android 6. App stores and providers more and more face the challenge of considering privacy concerns of their users and implement privacy assurance approaches to alleviate those concerns, of which opt-out mechanisms are one such approach. In IS research, perceived control has been found to influence information privacy concerns, for example, in a study by Xu, Teo et al. (2012) or in another study by Wang et al. (2016). Several studies suggest that low levels of perceived control heightens individuals’ risk perceptions, which in turn reduces their capabilities to affect changes in the environment in a desired direction (Du, Keil, Mathiassen, Shen, & Tiwana, 2007; Lang, Wiesche, & Krcmar, 2018). In a mobile environment, this implicates that users will not feel empowered to control their personal information, when app providers

do not provide them with possibilities such as turning the location of an app on and off, which will result in growing privacy concerns for users (Lang et al., 2018; Xu, 2007; Xu, Gupta et al., 2012). Based on these lines of logic, we propose the following hypothesis:
