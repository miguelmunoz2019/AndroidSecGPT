- How does security fit in your priorities?
- Which software security best practices are you familiar with?
- Are there any obligations by your supervisor/employer for performing security testing?
- What methods do you use to try to ensure the security of applications?
- Do you perform testing on your (or someone else’s) applications/code?
- Do you perform code reviews?
