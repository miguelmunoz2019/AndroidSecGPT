# 2. Mobile security perceptions
Users’ behavioral security has been studied in numerous contexts in IS research, such as mobile technologies (Harris et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2018; Keith, Babb, Lowry, Furner, & Abdullat, 2015), computer security (Johnston & Warkentin, 2010), internet security (Chen & Zahedi, 2016), online shopping (Pavlou, Liang, & Xue, 2007), and online transactions . Here, the focus is on security perceptions, which is the central construct in the behavioral stream of research on security because it affects user intentions and behaviors (Pavlou et al., 2007; White, Ekin, & Visinescu, 2017). By extension, we define the perceived security of mobile apps as the perception of the app provider’s appropriate actions to safeguard shared information from security breaches during and after transmission through the mobile phone . By understanding the factors that affect mobile app users’ perceived security, this study contributes to the ongoing conversation in the literature on behavioral security.

One of the issues that online shopping websites face, especially in their early stages, is the lack of user trust in the security of the website. Customers must share their financial information with the website, which can be abused by the website if not guarded well . Users’ perceptions of security can affect their attitude and behaviors directly and indirectly. For example, Chellappa (2008) and Bansal (2017) demonstrated that an individual’s perception of security is the building block of trust (indirect) towards any form of electronic transaction, which can fuel users’ behavioral intentions (direct), such as their intention to share private information with websites (Bansal, Zahedi, & Gefen, 2015). With a slightly different perspective, Kim, Steinfield, and Lai (2008) found that web assurance seal services can considerably mitigate users’ security concerns. There are studies that specifically examine how an individual’s perceptions of security can trigger coping and compliance behaviors. Examples of coping behaviors include avoidance, protective actions, and seeking help, which justify the motivations behind individuals’ self-protection in online environments (Chen & Zahedi, 2016). For instance, Johnston and Warkentin (2010) indicated how security perceptions can indirectly lead to organizational security compliance, which is a significant problem in many companies.

To the best of our knowledge, few studies have focused specifically on the role of perceived security in the mobile app context. For example, Johnson et al. (2018) showed that perceived security affects the usage intentions of individuals in an empirical study of mobile payment apps. They showed that the perceived security of the mobile payment could be a function of the perceived privacy risk, ubiquity (user exposure to similar or the same thing), and trialability (having the opportunity to experiment with the technology; Johnson et al., 2018). Susanto, Chang, and Ha (2016) demonstrated that mobile security perception plays an important role in shaping user trust and satisfaction in mobile banking apps. Along similar lines, Ooi and Tan (2016) showed that security perception is the key influencer of behavioral intentions to use mobile app features, such as smartphone credit cards. However, research on the factors that impact user perceptions of mobile app security is sparse and, therefore, is studied here.

# 2. Mobile privacy perception
The functionality of many apps is overshadowed because of users’ privacy concerns when using such apps . We define perceived information privacy in the mobile app context as the ability of the individual to control when, how, and to what extent, their personal information is communicated to mobile apps (Hong & Thong, 2013). In this study, the exposure of private information through unauthorized access, such as hacking incidents, is viewed as a security incident and discussed in Section 2. In this section, the concerns over privacy exposure focus on inappropriate use or misconduct by the app providers.

Users’ privacy concerns are salient in the data collection and control processes that businesses exercise when managing shared data . By extension, recent work suggests that privacy concerns can be viewed as a multi-dimensional construct that consists of awareness about current privacy practices, information management by the party with whom they share personal information, and interaction management between the user and the third party (Hong & Thong, 2013). An individual’s privacy perceptions will affect their behavior and attitudes, such as trust, willingness to use, intention to use, and intention to disclose information (Dinev et al., 2006; Lowry, Cao, & Everard, 2011; Malhotra et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2011; Xu, Teo, Tan, & Agarwal, 2009). Studies on the privacy paradox have also found that customers (or individuals in general) who seek more information transparency are less inclined to disclose information about themselves (Awad & Krishnan, 2006; Norberg, Horne, & Horne, 2007; Xu, Dinev, Smith, & Hart, 2011).

Existing studies have shown that privacy can directly or indirectly influence user attitudes and decisions to use mobile apps or share personal information with them. Wottrich, van Reijmersdal, and Smit (2018) found that the perceived privacy concerns of mobile app users in Western Europe negatively influenced their intentions to approve app permission requests to access their personal information. It has been demonstrated in multiple studies that both general perceived privacy concerns and perceived privacy risks directly and indirectly influence users’ willingness to disclose personal information (e.g., identification, location, photos) to mobile apps , intention to pay to mobile apps (Keith, Thompson, Hale, Lowry, & Greer, 2013; Keith, Babb, Lowry, Furner, & Abdullat, 2015; Keith et al., 2016), and intention to adopt mobile apps (Luo, Li, Zhang, & Shim, 2010). The next sub-section provides an overview of the connection between privacy and security in IS research.

# 2. Interconnection of privacy and security
Privacy and security concerns are mutually exclusive, yet they affect each other , and are both very sensible for customers in online transactions . In IS research, privacy has been studied independently and in conjunction with security . It appears that both are equally important, particularly if sensitive information is being transferred between parties (Bansal & Zahedi, 2014). Kim (2008) studied the effects of security and privacy, at the individual and the collective level, on trust in e-vendors. He found that security positively influences trust on both levels, but privacy affects trust negatively only on the individual level. Kim et al. (2008) found that security is the main predictor of seal service awareness, but privacy is not. Roca, García, and de la Vega (2009) found a similar result to Kim et al. (2008), by testing the effects of both privacy and security perceptions on trust among users of online trading systems. Bansal and Zahedi (2014) advanced the idea of the effects of security and privacy concerns on trust, finding that each behaves differently in altered experimental conditions.

It has been established that in e-commerce transactions, user privacy perceptions positively influence their security perceptions . Shin (2010) demonstrated that users’ perceptions of privacy on social network sites affects their security perceptions. Ponte, Carvajal-Trujillo, and Escobar-Rodríguez (2015) showed that the antecedents of privacy and security affect each other, identifying the need to further investigate the interaction between these two equally important constructs in privacy and security literature. Against this backdrop, this study assumes that privacy perceptions affect perceived security. Therefore, this study extends and contributes to the interconnection of privacy and security literature in the context of mobile apps.

# 2. Communication privacy management theory
This study draws on CPM theory, which explains the boundaries of self-disclosure within interpersonal relationships . CPM theory (Petronio, 2002, 2008) posits that individuals draw implicit lines (boundaries) around themselves, to regulate the way their personal information is transacted. These boundaries overlap and are shared with third-parties associated with the individual (e.g., friends, family, coworkers, lawyers, physicians). The implicit rules and the degree of overlap between an individual’s boundaries are very dependent on the social context and the type of information (Choi & Land, 2016). The underlying assumption of CPM is that individual ownership of information is the key factor in assessing whether to share personal information in transactions. The two parties involved in information disclosure can coordinate the use of the shared personal information. The mismanagement of shared personal information by either side can cause ‘turbulence’ (Acquisti, Brandimarte, & Loewenstein, 2015). Turbulence between the individual and the co-owner of the shared information occurs when the co-owner violates ownership expectations, and can frequently appear due to the complexity of the coordination process.
