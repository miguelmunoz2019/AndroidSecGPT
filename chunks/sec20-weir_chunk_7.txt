Calculation of Scores
This section describes how scores were calculated from the survey answers.

Likert-Style Scales were encoded as:
- Extremely … (4)
- Very … (3)
- Moderately … (2)
- Slightly …(1)
- Not … at all (0)
Assurance Technique Score: sum of all five sub-questions of Q21, each encoded as shown.

Developer Knowledge Score: LSS encoding of Q14
Expertise Support Score: as the following table.

Requirements Score: sum of LSS encodings for Q12 (Secure against malicious attackers), Q12 (Protects users' privacy) and Q13
Security Update Frequency Score: This required an Update Frequency Estimate of Q10 encoded as shown multiplied by Q11 (Security bug fixes) and divided by 100. The score was Log (this value plus 1).

Model Comparison
To compare a decision tree model, we used the Python scikit-learn library’s DecisionTreeRegressor, compared with Stats-Models’ OLS (Ordinary Least Squares).

We compared each pair of models using the F-Test calculation , taking the number of ‘leaf nodes’ in the decision tree as the degrees of freedom for that model in the F-Test.

Applying the Bonferroni correction , we took the required Alpha P-value for significance as 0. The calculated P-values values ranged from 0 to 0, and did not approach that value.
