# Conclusion
In this article, we assess the correctness of implemented authentication protocols in Android applications. Targeting both password authentication protocol and one-time password authentication protocol, we study secure ways to protect password authentication and OTP authentication against attacks. Based on these secure methods, we develop a system to identify whether those authentication implementation follow the requirements. Our system extracts control and data dependencies of an application and relies on a machine learning algorithm to learn the characteristics of each type of authentication bugs. In total, we collect 1200 Android applications and create the ground truth by ourselves. Compared to a state-of-the-art tool, MalloDroid, our system performs much better, achieving precision, recall, and F1 with 52, 93, and 67 percent. Not only is the authentication between mobile applications vulnerable, but also authentication between mobile applications and IoT devices. We will further analyze whether the authentication of IoT devices is secure.
