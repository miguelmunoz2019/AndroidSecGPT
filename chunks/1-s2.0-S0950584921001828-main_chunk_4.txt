only to this set and allowed new value themes to emerge from the issues. For the main study, we also included another app, Focus, which has different functionalities to Signal and K-9. We randomly sampled 1,097 issues consisting of 5,615 posts from these three projects. This number of issues corresponds to a sample that gives a 95% confidence level and 5% confidence interval. Table 3 shows the number of issues and posts analysed in the main study from each project.

# 3. Analysis for RQ1
To answer RQ1, i.e., what values are discovered in issue discussions, we conducted a qualitative analysis using open coding with constant comparisons. Using the constant comparison method, newly found themes are constantly compared to the previously found themes . We used constant comparison to refine the descriptions and ensure the consistency of value themes that we found. To compare our findings with the existing theory, we then mapped the themes that we found in the empirical analysis with the theory of Schwartz’s refined value model. Fig. 6 shows the relation between Schwartz’s values and our main study. This picture shows that we mapped the themes that we found with Schwartz’s refined theory of basic values.

During the qualitative analysis, there was a limitation in terms of the availability of the analysts. To overcome this, we divided the analysis process into two phases, namely values discovery followed by validation and adjustment. The values discovery phase was conducted by the primary analyst in the pilot study. In the next phase, three validators were employed to validate a subset of the primary analyst’s analysis results. The details of each phase are explained as follows:
# Values Discovery
In this phase, the primary analyst analysed issue discussions for value themes. The primary analyst was allowed to propose any value themes without having to strictly refer to the initial set of themes from the pilot study. For each value theme found, the analyst formulated a description from phrases found in the issue discussions. Similar to the pilot study, we did not limit the number of value themes to be found in an issue discussion. Then, the primary analyst attempted to map each theme found to human values from Schwartz’s refined value model. This model was chosen because it has a finer distinction of each value than the previous model . It took approximately two months for the primary analyst to complete this phase.

# Values Validation and Adjustment
Once the values discovery phase finished, a validation was conducted on the analysis result. The validators ranged from research fellows to a professor. All of them had backgrounds in software engineering. Two of the validators were involved in the pilot study. A new validator was introduced to address possible bias in the validation due to the previous involvement in the pilot study. The new validator was also asked to study literature on human values prior to the validation.

To obtain a significant sample for the validation, we randomly sampled the issues analysed in the previous step using a confidence level of 95% with a 5% margin of errors resulting in 349 issues consisting of 1,976 posts. The first, second, and third validators were allocated 150, 100, and 99 issues, respectively. This allocation scheme was based on the time availability of the validators. The validators were asked to review each assigned issue. They had to indicate whether they agreed or disagreed with the primary analyst’s analysis and provide comments. The validators were given two weeks to complete the validation.

At the end of the validation process, the primary analyst held a meeting with each validator. Before the meeting, the agreement between the validators and the analyst was 72%. After the meeting, the agreement reached 89%. The primary sources of disagreements were as follows:
- Refinements to the definition of the emerging values. The validators proposed several refinements to the descriptions of existing values based on their findings. For example, a validator found a conversation in issue discussions, indicating that users still need help from a contributor to configure the app if they change their phone. A validator then proposed to broaden the description of independence by adding ‘relying on someone else’ to cover the issue. These refinements were agreed upon by the analyst and the validators.

- Different inference process in the analysis. A validator proposed to include themes relevant to human values that are not directly relevant, i.e., requires some steps of inference. For example, a user reported that in Android Auto, the app displayed only the latest message from a contact, not the complete messages. The validator proposed a value of ‘helpful’ based on the reasoning that displaying all messages from contact is more helpful to a user.

Once the validation finished, the primary analyst updated the final labelling for 349 issues. The primary analyst then revisited the remaining 748 issues and made adjustments based on the validation.

and adjustment phase insights. It took approximately three weeks for the primary analyst to adjust the dataset. We used this analysis result to answer the first research question.

# 3. Analysis for RQ2
For RQ2, we used the analysed dataset of qualitative analysis for RQ1. To answer the first part of RQ2, i.e., does the presence of values differ across projects, we conducted a quantitative analysis to obtain the number of issues where values are present in each project. Because the number of analysed issues differed for each project, we performed the analysis using the percentage of issues where values are present on each project instead of the number of issues.

To answer RQ2, we first identified and compared which values were more prevalent in each project. Afterwards, we compared the presence of values across projects. To this end, we identified which values have a substantial difference of presence across projects, followed by a qualitative analysis to comprehend the nature of their corresponding issue discussions and if they are different across projects.

# 4. Results
In this section, we describe the result of our analysis following the research questions:
- RQ1 What values are discovered in issue discussions?
- RQ2 Does the presence of values differ across projects? If so, how?
# 4. RQ1: values discovered
In the analysis of the three applications (Signal, K-9, and Focus), we discovered 20 value themes. Among them, 15 themes were the same value themes as identified in the pilot study. The remaining five themes emerged in the main study. We mapped these 20 themes to Schwartz’s values as depicted in Fig. 6. We found ten of them could be mapped directly to Schwartz’s values (i.e., human value themes). Meanwhile, the other ten themes were technical and required an extra step of inference to Schwartz’s values or could not be mapped (see PO4 in Section 3). We referred to such themes as system value themes, as they are important for users when using the application (or system–human interaction).

# 4. Human value themes
We discovered ten themes that could be mapped to Schwartz values. Table 4 presents these themes, their description, and their mapping to Schwartz’s refined theory of basic values . The description of each theme is conceptualised from the issue discussion and represents how its corresponding human value could be manifested in software development. Conformity is about how an application follows the rules, regulations, guidelines, or standard practices. For example, we found a Signal’s user who complained about the displayed text that did not align with the Android design guidelines. This theme could be mapped into Conformity - Rules in Schwartz. Pleasure promotes the enjoyment of using the application. For instance, a contributor believed that emojis in Signal is amusing: ‘I do not see what you are complaining about, it [emojis] is a fun feature’. Pleasure has a similar concept with Hedonism in Schwartz’s. Dignity, which can be mapped to Face, is about maintaining honour and respect for users while using the application. For example, we found a user reported, ‘I have been in a huge fight with the Vodafone customer service, called them at least 10 times, have ruined their shop over here in Germany, write multiple heavy complaints to them and was really upset - until my girlfriend noticed that this Issue appeared since we have been using [the app]’. Inclusiveness ensures anyone with diverse backgrounds could use the application. This theme could be mapped to Universalism - Concern. Inclusiveness in an application could manifest as user interface translation or other regional specific settings such as a right-to-left layout to support the Arabic language. Sense of belonging is about how users can connect and interact with their peers through the application. This theme could be mapped to Security - Personal. As an example for this theme, we found a user of Signal complained, ‘I have been invited to a group of friends and I have not received invite or messages’.
