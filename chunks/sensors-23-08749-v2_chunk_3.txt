# 2. Blockchain Data Storage, How to?
Blockchains utilize a distributed and decentralized network of computers known as nodes to store data [25, 73–77]. The data is organized into blocks, with each block containing a collection of transactions or other pertinent information [78–81]. Blockchains employ a systematic approach to data storage, encompassing the following key elements: each block within the blockchain consists of two core components—a header and a data section. The header contains vital metadata such as a timestamp, a reference to the previous block, and a unique identifier referred to as a hash, while the data section encompasses the actual stored information or transactions. Before incorporation into the blockchain, the data section undergoes a cryptographic hashing process, yielding a distinct, fixed-size character string known as a hash. This hash, generated from the block’s data, serves the crucial role of identifying and validating the block’s integrity. Furthermore, the hashed transactions undergo a process known as Merkle tree construction. These transactions are paired and repeatedly hashed, producing a new set of hashes with each iteration. This iterative process persists until a single hash, termed the Merkle root, is attained. The Merkle tree, organized as a binary tree structure, features leaf nodes representing the hashed transactions and internal nodes representing the hashes of their child nodes. Situated in the block header, the Merkle root serves as a succinct representation and unique identifier for all transactions within the block. This allows for swift verification of the entire transaction set.

To establish a chronological order, blocks in the blockchain are linked together. Each block includes a reference (hash) to the preceding block, forming a continuous chain of interconnected blocks. This linkage mechanism ensures that any alterations to a previous block necessitate the recalculation of hashes for all subsequent blocks. In a decentralized blockchain network, multiple nodes collaborate in data validation and storage. When a new block is added, it is distributed across the network, with each participating node autonomously verifying the block’s validity through the examination of its contained hash and transactions. Various consensus algorithms are employed to reach an agreement on the block’s validity. Once a block garners validation from the network, it is appended to the individual blockchain copies maintained by each participating node. These copies undergo continuous updates and synchronization to mirror the latest blockchain state. This replication process guarantees data distribution and redundancy across numerous nodes, consequently enhancing blockchain security and resilience. Through the integration of these processes, blockchain furnishes a transparent, tamper-resistant, and verifiable approach to data storage, devoid of reliance on a central governing authority.

# 2. Blockchain Attacks and Mitigation
While blockchain technology offers robust security features, it is essential to acknowledge and address potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities that can emerge across various layers of the blockchain ecosystem. These include the 51% attack, primarily affecting Proof of Work (PoW) networks, where an entity controlling the majority of computational power can manipulate the blockchain. Smart contract vulnerabilities can arise from coding errors, leading to unexpected behavior or security breaches. Ensuring private key security is crucial, as compromised keys can lead to unauthorized access or tampering. Sybil attacks involve creating fake identities to disrupt the network, and network layer vulnerabilities, like DDoS attacks, can compromise connectivity. Decentralized governance can introduce governance and legal risks, impacting network security and stability. Additionally, specific attacks like the Finney attack, brute-force attack, and selfish mining attack pose distinct threats to blockchain security.

While vulnerabilities do exist in blockchain systems, many of them require substantial resources, technical expertise, or specific conditions for successful exploitation. The blockchain community actively addresses these vulnerabilities [83 – 88] through security research, best practices implementation, code audits, and continuous development efforts, aiming to enhance system security and robustness. Strategies to mitigate these vulnerabilities include implementing alternative consensus mechanisms like Proof of Stake (PoS) or Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), increasing network size and diversity, conducting smart contract audits, employing formal verification methods, ensuring robust key management through hardware wallets and multi-factor authentication, and establishing secure backup and recovery procedures. Sybil attack resistance can be achieved through reputation systems, PoS mechanisms, and identity verification protocols. Network security measures involve firewalls, traffic filtering, encryption, peer authentication, and regular security assessments. Governance and regulatory compliance are facilitated by transparent governance structures, adherence to regulations, and collaboration with regulatory bodies to align blockchain practices with legal frameworks. These proactive measures collectively contribute to bolstering blockchain security and resilience against potential threats and vulnerabilities.

Blockchain technology has gained significant attention for its potential to revolutionize various industries, including finance, supply chain management, healthcare, and more. One area where blockchain’s impact is becoming increasingly prominent is mobile app development. Here, we explore the history and related work that highlights the integration of blockchain technology into the realm of mobile applications.

# 3. History
The inception of blockchain, originally conceptualized for timestamping digital documents, received considerable attention in 2008 with the introduction of Bitcoin. While the decentralized nature of Bitcoin demonstrated blockchain’s potential, by the early 2010s, visionaries recognized its broader applicability, especially in enhancing mobile app data storage security. Between 2015 and the late 2010s, as initial implementations emerged, industries with critical security requirements, like finance and healthcare, began integrating blockchain technology to protect user data. However, this surge also unveiled challenges, including scalability, energy consumption, and latency. As a response, the industry explored off-chain storage, sidechains, and sharding to surmount these hurdles. By the early 2020s, with mobile devices’ limited capabilities in focus, the emphasis shifted towards lightweight blockchain designs. Innovations, such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs, allowed for efficient data transaction validations without data exposure, further cementing blockchain’s role in fortifying mobile app data storage security. Today, as mobile apps increasingly handle sensitive information, blockchain stands as a beacon for enhanced security and user trust. Real-life examples are discussed in the coming subsection.
