# ABSTRACT
Smartphone users do not fully know what their apps do. For example, an applications’ network usage and underlying security configuration is invisible to users. In this paper we introduce Securacy, a mobile app that explores users’ privacy and security concerns with Android apps. Securacy takes a reactive, personalized approach, highlighting app permission settings that the user has previously stated are concerning, and provides feedback on the use of secure and insecure network communication for each app. We began our design of Securacy by conducting a literature review and in-depth interviews with 30 participants to understand their concerns. We used this knowledge to build Securacy and evaluated its use by another set of 218 anonymous participants who installed the application from the Google Play store. Our results show that access to address book information is by far the biggest privacy concern. Over half (56%) of the connections made by apps are insecure, and the destination of the majority of network traffic is North America, regardless of the location of the user. Our app provides unprecedented insight into Android applications’ communications behavior globally, indicating that the majority of apps currently use insecure network connections.

# 1. INTRODUCTION
Recent studies  of malware reveal that the incentives for acquiring personal data are on the rise (e.g., data for advertisers, in-app billing fraud) and consequently, user data is increasingly at risk. Users can be affected in several ways, including data theft or corruption, annoyance, device damage or location tracking . Unfortunately, the automated screening process used by mobile app stores to detect malware are unreliable and can be circumvented.

In fact, the proliferation of malicious applications on mobile app stores has raised concerns regarding the potential harmful collection of personal data . Once on the smartphone, malware may attempt to spread to other devices and/or enable remote data access. Many important features of smartphones require Internet connectivity, and therefore disabling network connectivity is not a practical solution to the problems generated by malware. In addition, global mobile Internet usage doubled between 2010 and 2011 and is estimated to increase 18-fold by 2016 . As such, personal data may become increasingly vulnerable to capture by unwanted third parties.

More critically, mobile apps often provide the user with explicit network usage actions such as loading a webpage or sending email, however, nearly 70% of network traffic generated by a device is invisible to the user . On Android, users can check the volume of traffic sent but do not receive a breakdown of what and how data was sent and to where. In other words, it is challenging for user to recognize a suspicious application that may be generating unwanted and potentially harmful traffic.

To empirically investigate apps’ covert network usage and better understand how users decide what permissions are acceptable for an application, we created a tool, called Securacy, that:
- Provides insight into the applications’ network connections that are established behind the scenes, including the use or otherwise of secure network connections and the geographical destination of the app data;
- Allows users to rate applications on potential permission abuse or use of insecure network connections, sharing the application’s rating with all Securacy users;
- Notifies users of any potential network, security or privacy threat before first application use, based on shared ratings.

Our work has a similar motivation to Kepler , a browser extension that monitors and maps network data access, to raise users’ awareness on widespread adware and spyware on desktop machines. However, on smartphones, mobile applications are provided with structured APIs that supply a significantly larger amount of sensitive user and sensor data when compared with browsers on desktop platforms.

When a user rates or uninstalls an application, we use experience sampling  to understand their concerns about mobile network usage, security and privacy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study that investigates the combined effect of network security, server location and application permissions and user perceptions of applications’ security and privacy.

We make the following contributions:
- A review on the exposed potential threats and systems that attempt to protect user privacy; and studies that investigate users’ attitudes to privacy and security;
# A qualitative assessment of users’ app installation decision process and users’ security and privacy concerns;
- An intervention conducted in natural settings, deployed as an application that supports the users’ mental model and mitigates users’ security and privacy concerns;
- Insight into applications’ network use and security: which servers do applications use the most and where are they located; and are they using secure or insecure network connections;
- An interpretation of the trust users place in applications and their rationale for uninstalling them; and the implications of our findings on future mobile applications’ network use.

# RELATED WORK
Smartphones come bundled with an increasing number of sensors. Besides mobile interaction (e.g., using the accelerometer data to automatically rotate the screen), these sensors can be used to recognize its owner’s context (e.g., Google Now functionalities). However, privacy fears raised by the Snowden revelations and the fear of someone listening in has given rise to additional concerns about smartphone sensors, for example, the “always listening” functionality on Moto X devices.

Android’s security architecture uses a combination of permission- and signature-based checks. Consequently, an application needs to explicitly request access to some functionality (i.e., application permissions), and an application can only be updated if digitally signed with the same certificate as the installed application. Unfortunately, this approach has not prevented apps abusing the privacy of Android users. In general, iOS users are less exposed to privacy or security concerns, due in part to the mandatory code review process imposed by Apple on all submitted applications. However, malware does exist for iOS, but only 5% of iOS vs 20% of Android users are concerned about their privacy.

Kelley et al.’s  “privacy facts” prototype demonstrated that it is possible to improve user understanding of application permissions by increasing the clarity and display of the required permissions during the install dialog. AppProfiler  used anonymous feedback from users about application permissions to automatically generate a high-level summary (e.g., acceptable, not acceptable, surprising). AppGuard  is an Android application which recompiles Android applications installed on a phone handset. Recompilation inserts a security monitor that can be configured at runtime by the user to enforce privacy policies. Since AppGuard does not modify the operating system it does not require root or custom firmware to function. It does not work with all applications and the process needs to be repeated for every application update. It currently does not work on Android 5 and above (approximately 5% of the active Android devices ).

# 3. Understanding users’ application installation decision process and permission recall
To understand our requirements better, we conducted an information gathering study. We recruited our participants by affixing flyers around the University of Oulu campus. All participants were compensated with a three Euro coffee voucher. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 Android phone owners (9 female, 21 male), aged between 20 and 41 (M=28; SD=5) years old. The recruitment process targeted smartphone users rather than developers. All our participants were students, ranging from computer science to biology majors.

We created a questionnaire based on previous findings about users’ privacy and security concerns  to capture the decision making process our participants went through when installing an application. We used a Likert-scale (1-totally disagree, 2-slightly disagree, 3-not sure, 4-slightly agree, 5-totally agree) for the following statements:
- “When you install an application…”
- It is important to recognize who created the application;
- I trust my data to the developer I recognize;
- I always check the application’s permissions;
- I worry about how safe my network connection is;
- I care about others’ ratings on the application store;
- I rate applications I like.
