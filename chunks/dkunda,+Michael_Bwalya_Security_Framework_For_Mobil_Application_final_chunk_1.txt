# Abstract
Currently, mobile applications are playing a major role in many areas such as banking, social networking, financial apps, entertainment and many more. The increase in number of applications succumbs to several security vulnerabilities and thus focus should be given to security. As the number of vulnerabilities and, hence, of attacks increase, mobile applications need to be assessed and ensure that secure coding practices have been followed during development. Mobile application security breach can lead to fraudulent transactions through mobile applications, confidentiality and revenue loss through communications services misuse. Data that is shared on an unsecured channel is vulnerable to attacks and to stop unauthorized access to this data, there is need to encrypt the data before it is sent to the server. In this research work, different cryptographic algorithms for encrypting data and secure data sharing in mobile applications across communications channels were examined. Simulation methodology was used to investigate a suitable cryptographic algorithm and to design a security framework for mobile applications to solve mobile application security problems. The proposed framework employs the use of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm for encrypting meter readings data being exchanged between a smart phone and a server. The meter reading datasets used in this research were obtained from the Water Utility Mobile Application for Meter Reading. The results obtained from the simulation of the security framework, showed that four fields namely: Account number, image path, meter number and phone number on which AES encryption was applied were in an unreadable format (ciphertext), implying that the fields have been successfully encrypted. This solution allows application users (meter readers) to transfer (upload readings) data between a smart phone and database server in a secure manner without facing the problem of data attack. Data being uploaded to the server is encrypted before it is transferred and decrypted once it reaches the server side. This solution addresses android application security in the application and network communications layers and data transmission. The research paper ensures information security is guaranteed between an organisation and its customers.

# I. Introduction
Mobile devices are quickly becoming the platform of choice for organizations to conduct business more effectively. There is a wide range of functionalities provided to the users by the mobile devices such as fast connection to social platforms, personal data storing, financial processes, web browsing and tons of services. Android based devices have attracted massive market share due to its open architecture and the popularity of its application programming interface (APIs) in the developer community. The expanded popularity of the Android devices and associated monetary benefits has made it an ideal target for malware developers, resulting in big rise of the Android based security issues . According to , the directness of these environments will lead to new applications and markets and will enable greater interfacing with existing online services. However, as the importance of the data and services of smartphones increases, so too do the opportunities for vulnerability. It is therefore important that this next generation of platforms provide a comprehensive and usable security infrastructure.

In view of the above, this research involves developing a security framework that employs the use of cryptography in a mobile application system. Cryptography is the technique and science of keeping messages secure . Cryptography is an integral part of modern world information security making the virtual world a safer place  and it is the best way for encryption . Cryptography converts the original data into ciphertext which is an unreadable form (Encryption) and again converts the ciphertext into original form (Decryption) . The two widely accepted and used cryptographic methods are 1) Symmetric-key algorithms 2) Asymmetric-key algorithms. Symmetric algorithms utilize the same key for encryption and decryption. This is termed as secret key. By using the same key, messages are encrypted by the sender and decrypted by the receiver. It contains algorithms like Data Encryption Standard (DES), Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Triple DES.

Blowfish etc. Asymmetric algorithms use different keys. Public key is used for encryption and other private key is used for decryption. This is known as public key. The public key is known to the public and the private key is known to the user. It comprises various algorithms like Rivest, Shamir, & Adleman (RSA), Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), Elliptic Curve(EC), Diffi-Hillman(DH).

The proposed solution uses symmetric algorithm as it has the speed and computational efficiency to handle encryption of large volumes of data. The strength of the encryption in symmetric cryptosystems goes with longer the key length. AES is the commonly used encryption technique nowadays, this algorithm is based on many substitutions, permutations and linear transformations, each executed on data blocks of 16 byte. As of today, there are no practicable attacks that exist against AES. Therefore, AES remains the preferred encryption standard for governments, banks and high security systems around the world , ,.

This solution allows data to be encrypted before it is sent and decrypts the data once it reaches the server. In this regard, the solution addresses the concerns in android application security in the application and network communications layers and data transmission thereby achieving security goals of data namely: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA).

This study will potentially identify critical success factors for Companies planning to start using mobile technologies to protect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of information in today’s highly networked systems environment. This paper is valuable in that, Companies will have remediation measures and controls needed to mitigate identified vulnerabilities and implement secure interfaces. Apart from that, Mapping vulnerabilities to flaws at the architecture and design level helps prepare a comprehensive remediation plan.

# II. Threats and Attacks in Mobile Applications
# Type of attacks in network security
There are several type of attacks possible in a network that can be divided two categories , :
1. Passive attacks: In these attacks, an attacker intercepts the data on transit with the intention of reading and analyzing the information not for modifying it. These are attacks in which attacker play no active part and there are less chances of an attacker’s identity getting revealed. Wiretapping, sniffing and eavesdropping fall under this group.

2. Active attacks: In these attacks, an attacker intercepts the connection and alters the data. This can be done by sending virus, Trojan or any malicious packet and the chances of attacker getting traced back are there. Denial of Service, Domain Name System (DNS) spoofing, Man in the middle attack, Address Resolution Protocol(ARP) poisoning, Buffer overflow, Heap overflow and Structured query Language (SQL) Injection are common active type attacks.

# Types of attacks in mobiles
The increase in mobile phone use has made it easy for attackers to attack as they have now a larger platform to exploit. There are a number of ways in which the type of attacks in mobiles can be segregated. Some of them are explained as follows:
# Wi-Fi based attacks
An attacker can intercept a Wi-Fi communication by doing eavesdropping. The security in WLAN is more vulnerable. It is possible for an attacker to break the password easily get in the local network of the victim. In an event where an attacker prospers in breaking identification cipher, it becomes possible to attack both the phone and the entire network.

# Web browser based attack
In web browser based attacks, an attacker uses leverages like stack based overflow and other vulnerabilities in libraries. This is possible in all kinds of operating system either Android or iOS. Smartphones are also vulnerable to phishing and other malicious web site based attacks and the biggest problem with smartphones is that they don’t have strong antivirus protection yet.

# Operating System based attacks
One may apply any number of secure mechanisms but if there is vulnerability in operating system, it might be going to affect one day surely. There are several loopholes in operating systems of smartphones as these are in earlier stages and developers are not much aware about the kind of attacks possible. It was likely to dodge the security of operating system and circumvent the bytecode verifier and gain access of core operating system. Similarly in windows mobile OS, one can easily edit the general configuration file to a modifiable file. It is also possible for a malicious attacker to do modifications in the directory whenever an application is installed as at that time it has root privileges.
