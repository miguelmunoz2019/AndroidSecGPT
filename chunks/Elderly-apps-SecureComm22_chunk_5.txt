# Privacy Analysis of Android Apps for the Elderly
users’ activities and collect their pill taking habits; additionally, the legitimate caregiver will not receive any further notifications from the pillbox. Secondly, the EllieGrid solution offers a paid plan with additional functionalities for the elderly, such as viewing weekly adherence reports and adding a caregiver. Specifically, we found a parameter subscriptionTypeId from the user profile API, which sets the value of the current plan. An adversary can set this parameter’s value to premium and upgrade their EllieGrid account for free.

We also found some vulnerabilities by following the static analysis approach in Carego Alphahom, which provides a personal alarm system for the elderly. In particular, the app is vulnerable to the Janus vulnerability , in which an adversary can prepend a malicious DEX file to an APK file while keeping its signature unaffected. Android versions 5 - 8 accept the file as a valid APK.

# 4 Firebase Analysis
84/146 Android apps use Google Firebase as a backend service and we found 4/84 apps whose Firebase DB was exposed publicly. For ethical reasons and to protect other customers’ privacy, we created elderly accounts on the four apps. Then, we updated the Firebase scanner to automatically search for our test data in its response and record the leaked information from our own account. 2/4 apps (CogniFit and Carely) fixed this issue during the time of our testing. For UnitedHealthcare EVV Tennessee and Amerigroup EVV Tennessee, at the time of testing, we could not see any sensitive data being stored on their databases.

# 5 Limitations
As Google Play Store does not have a defined “Elderly” or “Senior” app category, our app search is limited to the keywords used. A major limitation we faced during our dynamic analysis was the inability to create accounts for 67/115 of our apps because the companies either make accounts for the users beforehand (and provide access information) or the apps will validate the user’s information (e.g., medical insurance numbers, and organization email IDs, which we cannot provide in our test accounts) before creating the account. This was most applicable for the EVV and caregiver apps. For those apps, we conduct a limited dynamic analysis of pre-login application behaviors. We also did not test any paid apps.

# 6 Related Work
Slane et al.  collected seniors’ perspectives on technological devices and applications to show how seniors protect their personal information, and what knowledge, tools, and support they would need in order to consider new functions or devices. Huckvale et al.  assessed 79 clinically safe medical/health apps used by chronic and unwell persons, and found that 23/79 of apps sent unencrypted PII over the Internet, 63/79 apps communicated directly with third-party services and 53/79 of apps had some form of privacy policy. However, this work does

not specifically study elderly users, or analyze the backend security issues. Frik et al.  identified a range of complex privacy and security attitudes and needs specific to older adults, along with common threat models, misconceptions, and mitigation strategies. They showed how older adults’ limited technical knowledge, experience, and declining abilities amplify vulnerability to certain risks. Oliveira et al.  showed that older women were the most vulnerable group to phishing attacks in a study of 158 internet users. Razaghpanah et al.  identified 2,121 third-party advertising and tracking services at the traffic level, of which 233 were previously unknown to other popular advertising and tracking blacklists. Their analysis of the privacy policies of the largest advertising and tracking service providers showed rampant sharing of harvested data with subsidiaries and third-party affiliates. Ren et al.  analyzed 512 apps for privacy leaks over time across three dimensions (PII leaks, HTTPS adoption, and domains contacted) independently, and found that app privacy gets worse as users upgrade apps and all apps leak at least one type of PII.

In contrast to the above work, we take an in-depth look at the security and privacy threats in Android apps used by the elderly. We also analyze traffic flows, PII or device information and usage leaks, dangerous permissions used by apps and third-party libraries, and backend security issues of high severity, using various tools for both dynamic and static analysis. Our initial framework also included Lumen Privacy Monitor for dynamic analysis of test apps, but we removed it from the framework as we found that Lumen did not uncover several security flaws as compared to Burp Suite. Even though Lumen would show leaks, there was a layer of uncertainty as to how a leak was transmitted (over HTTP or HTTPS) and where it was leaked (to the client-side product itself or to some third-party domains). Also, Lumen did not work reliably on newer Android versions and only worked best below Android 7. Hence, we decided to use a more manual approach with Burp Suite.

# 7 Conclusion
We presented a comprehensive analysis of 146 Android apps that are intended to assist elderly people. Our methodology included dynamic analysis of traffic domain flows, trackers, leaks, and permissions, static analysis of third-party libraries for risky permissions and vulnerable backend issues using various automated as well as manual tools. We reveal individually many red flags in 30/146 apps and how they are most likely to be a security risk. But also, in a wider sense, we have noticed trends in apps’ permissions and domain flows which show us how some companies, third-party libraries, or permissions dominate the segments. This is why we think the analysis should not stop here, as we can delve even deeper to find more flaws and vulnerabilities. This will create a safe environment for the elderly to have the peace of mind that their new smartphones are safe and they have one less thing to worry about.
