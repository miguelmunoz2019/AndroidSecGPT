# 2. RISK VALUE CALCULATION OF APPLICATIONS IN THE MARKETPLACE
Smartphone applications are an essential part of our daily life. From social media to banking to access medical reports, we are using mobile applications for ease of access -. More than 80% of smartphones run on the Android operating system . Such dominance in the market also makes Android an exclusive target for mobile threats. Security mechanisms are needed for such applications considering the sensitivity of the data. When we want to install any app from the Android Playstore, it does ask permission to access personal data, location, camera etc. Some malicious applications take advantage of these permissions, as most of the users tend to accept the clause without thinking about the impacts due to the complex language in the clause or the lack of time or understanding. Once these malicious applications gain access to the personal data, they can access our location, photos, camera, internet, or anything they can use for the attack -. Due to the massive collection of applications on the play store, it is difficult to recognize which applications are genuine and which are not. Since Android allows third-party developers applications to be released in the play-store security cannot be guaranteed from those applications as well. Also, some

Unofficial markets do not have any centralized control so untrusted developers can distribute malicious applications. Playstore itself cannot track all the applications yet for its maliciousness and common users do not have the understanding to identify which applications can misuse their data. There should be a mechanism in the AppStore, that can indicate the severity of the risk posed by the applications if we accept the permission clause -. There needs to be some scoring system that can define how safe is the app to install without compromising personal data. Figure 1 shows the timeline of the Android evolution with vulnerabilities and version updates. On many occasions, attackers were able to gain root privileges to take over the control of the device.

Android applications put their users at risk in a variety of ways, such as by using code that may jeopardize user privacy or device integrity , . The majority of existing security countermeasures for identifying unsafe applications have flaws, most of which are linked to devices comprehension and acceptance. As a result, consumers will benefit from a clear but successful method of determining if an application is secure. Android applications pose many risks to their users, e.g., by including code that may threaten user privacy or system integrity , . Most of the current security countermeasures for detecting dangerous apps show some weaknesses, mainly related to users‚Äô understanding and acceptance. As a result, consumers will benefit from an easy but reliable method for determining if an application is safe to install or not.

# Android Version Timeline
Multi-criteria software evaluator of confidence for AndrOID (MAETROID) is one of the proposed frameworks for evaluating the trustworthiness of Android applications as depicted in Figure 2 . It evaluates the authenticity of the app before installation using analytical hierarchy process (AHP) . This evaluation is labelled to the app to rank the risk metric. The goal of this framework is to assign labels to the applications from Trusted, Medium or high risk by computing and comparing alternatives and criteria. It calculates the threat score using a weighted and normalized total of single threat scores obtained by manually reviewing all of Android's permissions. The MAETROID platform has been turned into an Android application . When a new app is getting installed, MAETROID intercepts the information and does the analysis and shows the threat score to the user. Table 1 outlines the details of the threat levels and their meaning. The threat score is used to determine privacy threat, financial threat, system threat, and global threat.

Referenced articles mention different solutions proposed to increase security measures while installing any Android app. Several proposals suggest that a scoring system will help ensure common users are aware of these impacts before they can install the app and it will help them to decide to accept the risk or not. Some suggested calculating security risk scores based on permissions demanded by Android applications using crawl models and statistical measurements.

For an android device, the risk value calculation process is used to measure risk values. Optimal risk value is evaluated based on a set of selected malware and normal applications. Application is processed to extract data and then the risk is estimated using the risk parameters and then the final risk value is calculated. Extraction of data gets the permissions, API calls, resources, intentions. High rated malicious applications are used for sampling the risk associated. This way risk value is calculated, and the potential of the malicious application can be determined. When a user wants to install the application, risk value calculation (RVC) extracts features from the APK file and they are matched with the database stored with high-risk features and then it can accurately estimate the risk the applications possess as shown in Figure 3.

shows the RVC findings as well as the associated risk steps . The percentage of malicious applications is used to pick and identify each sorted list. The alarming rate and identification rate are the terms used to describe these two acts. Since there is no absolute alert rate threshold value for our assessment process, and it is also independent of the risk value collection, we must make a rational distinction between them at that stage. Similar to RVC, one more scoring system free update mean (FUM) scoring is available to use . Figure 5 illustrates the list of vulnerabilities discovered and patched over time as reported in.

The FUM Security matrices are used to rate system vendors and network operators based on their ability to provide upgrades and their vulnerability to critical vulnerabilities. a difficult-to-game composite FUM ranking (¬ß5). By reducing knowledge asymmetry, the FUM  score allows private and public sector consumers, as well as individuals, to make more educated buying decisions. These metrics free, upgrade and mean (F, U, M) together calculate a platform's protection in terms of known vulnerabilities and upgrades by calculating the proportion of operating devices free of critical vulnerabilities, the proportion of devices receiving the most recent Android version updates, and the mean amount of vulnerabilities yet to be patched. The FUM score is a ten-point scale that can be measured . We give F more weight because it is the most important metric. We map M into the range (0‚Äì1) since it is an unbounded positive real number. As a result, we have the FUM score:
ùêπùëàùëÄùë†ùëêùëúùëüùëí = 4ùêπ + 3ùëà + 31+ùëíùëÄ (1)
The FUM security metric evaluates, and rates system vendors and network operators based on their ability to provide upgrades and their vulnerability to crucial vulnerabilities. Buyers and regulators will use

the measure to see which system vendors and network providers have upgrades and which do not. Considering MAETROID is already implemented with the Android marketplace, and it is easier for the user to understand the threat score before installing the app, it is the preferred framework to use for preventing malicious applications.

# 3. METHOD
A growing area of concern for developers and users, regarding data security in mobile applications, is proper access control. Applications that do not take consideration in implementing an access control model can be taken advantage of to access private user data. This is an area of research that is still looking into developing frameworks and models to use as a metric to incorporate access control for mobile applications. The following subsections present and discuss the access control security in Android applications.
