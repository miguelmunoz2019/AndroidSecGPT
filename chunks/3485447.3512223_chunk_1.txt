# ABSTRACT
Past privacy measurement studies on web tracking focused on high-ranked commercial websites, as user tracking is extensively used for monetization on those sites. Conversely, governments across the globe now offer services online, which unlike commercial sites, are funded by public money, and do not generally make it to the top million website lists. As such, web tracking on those services has not been comprehensively studied, even though these services deal with privacy and security-sensitive user data, and used by a significant number of users. In this paper, we perform privacy and security measurements on government websites and Android apps: 150,244 unique websites (from 206 countries) and 1166 Android apps (from 71 countries). We found numerous commercial trackers on these services—e.g., 17% of government websites and 37% of government Android apps host Google trackers; 13% of government sites contain YouTube cookies with an expiry date in the year of 9999. 27% of government Android apps leak sensitive information (e.g., user/device identifiers, passwords, API keys) to third parties, or any network attacker (when sent over HTTP). We also found 304 government sites and 40 apps are flagged by VirusTotal as malicious. We hope our findings to help improve privacy and security of online government services, given that governments are now apparently taking Internet privacy/security seriously and imposing strict regulations on commercial sites.

# 1 INTRODUCTION
Tech giants such as Google, and Facebook constantly track online user behaviors to provide a better user experience, and more importantly, to improve user profiles that they curate for monetization, e.g., via advertisements. Users are aware of, and to some extent reluctantly submit themselves to such inevitable tracking on commercial websites, to get the so-called “free” services. In contrast, one may not expect commercial trackers on government web services as those are directly funded by the tax-payers’ money. Indeed, government sites are frequently used and highly trusted by users . Citizens use government websites and mobile apps to perform their civic obligations (e.g., taxes), query public services (e.g., waste disposal), and browse for important information (e.g., HIV, pregnancy, COVID-19). Tracking on these services could be quite revealing due to their sensitive nature . If combined with user profiles on commercial sites, such tracking can make it easier to manipulate real-world user behaviors (cf. voting as targeted by Cambridge Analytica ). Furthermore, possible exploitation of government sites by malicious actors can also directly compromise security of users; e.g., past attacks used government sites to distribute malware, ransomware, run a botnet and cryptocurrency mining.

Privacy implications of web tracking have been extensively studied. Englehardt et al.  developed OpenWPM for large-scale evaluation of web tracking, and found Google, Facebook, Twitter and AdNexus trackers on more than 10% of Alexa top 1 million websites . Privacy and security measurement studies (e.g., web tracking, HTTPS) also used sites published by Alexa, Tranco  and Cisco Umbrella , obviously due to the popularity of those top sites. However, only 9% government sites are present in commonly used top-million website lists , as government sites are used by a geographically-confined population.

Studies specifically targeting government websites (e.g., ), either focused on a specific country, or did not consider security and privacy issues in their evaluation. Recently, Singanamalla et al.  measured the HTTPS adoption errors and misconfigurations on government websites. In terms of tracking, a 2019 Cookiebot report  identified that 89% of EU government websites (e.g., nhs.uk, gov.uk) from 28 countries contained ad trackers (82% of which were from Google). However, a global perspective on commercial trackers on government services is still missing, even though governments across the world are increasingly making their services available online, especially during the current COVID-19 pandemic situation.

In this work, we perform a large-scale privacy and security measurement study on government services, using 150,244 unique government sites from 206 countries  and 1166 Android apps from 71 countries.

71 countries. We consider a website belongs to a government, if the domain name of the corresponding nameserver (ns) or mail exchanger (mx) record pertains to that government. We use a semi-automated methodology to identify 121,846 unique government domains, which we then complement with an additional 109,603 government domains from Singanamalla et al.  (totalling 231,449 distinct domains). We then crawl the landing pages from these domains using OpenWPM  and measure tracking prevalence on them; a total of 150,244 domains were successfully crawled (81,205 domains were inaccessible or inactive at the time of our crawl). We leverage the content saved from government websites to identify Google Play URLs and download 1166 government Android apps (after filtering non-government apps). To understand security and privacy exposure of these apps, we use both static analysis (MobSF , LiteRadar  and Firebase scanner ), and dynamic analysis techniques (using a Samsung S5 phone, with Google UI/Application Exerciser Monkey). However, we limit the security evaluation of government services due to possible legal and ethical issues. In addition, we scan all government and tracking (script/cookie) domains, and government Android APKs using VirusTotal  to determine the possible inclusion of malicious content in government websites/apps.

We characterize widespread tracking on government services as a betrayal by the governments, specifically when some jurisdictions (e.g., EU, California) have explicit laws (GDPR , CCPA ) to restrict tracking on commercial sites. Similarly, the breach of trust from compromised/malicious government apps  is also real.

# Contributions and notable findings
We develop a comprehensive framework for collecting government sites and Android apps, and a test methodology for evaluating them, primarily focusing on privacy exposure. Our main findings include:
1. We found widespread use of commercial trackers on government websites and apps. Unsurprisingly, major trackers that are present on the regular web (cf. ) also dominate on government services—e.g., Google trackers are on both government sites (17%) and Android apps (37%). There were tracking cookies set to last for a long time—13% (19,566) of government sites contain YouTube cookies with an expiry date in the year of 9999. These trackers are primarily due to the inclusion of commercial content (e.g., Google maps) on government sites, and the use of analytic libraries in apps. Privacy policies of 23 (out of a selected set of 227) government sites do not mention the use of any tracker. Whether explicitly mentioned or not in policy documents, these trackers can definitely correlate user activities across commercial and government services.

2. Government services from regions with strong privacy regulations such as the EU countries and the state of California (crawled from a localized VPN), also contain a lot of trackers, apparently violating their own regulations (GDPR and CCPA, respectively). For example, 49% (953/1942) and 69% (306/444) of EU and California government websites include known tracking scripts, respectively. These sites also include known tracking cookies with long validity periods; e.g., a total of 35 sites from both regions include known tracking cookies that are valid for 7984 years. Note that our crawler does not click on the cookie consent prompts, if present.

3. Surprisingly, there are government services that are apparently malicious, or load content from domains labelled as malicious as per VirusTotal (see Sec. 4); 304 government sites and 40 governments apps are labelled as malicious. In addition, 21 tracking domains (19 included in 377 sites, 2 included in 2 apps) are labelled as malicious.

4. Several government apps leak privacy/security sensitive information to trackers, or any network attacker. Examples: 23% (269/1166) of the apps expose device data (e.g., device model, device ID) to trackers; 7 apps send user login information in cleartext; 11 apps include hard-coded user/admin credentials and API keys; and 30 apps expose their unprotected Firebase datastores (apparently including confidential and personally identifiable information).
